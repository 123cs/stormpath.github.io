Welcome to the Stormpath Node.js Quickstart!

This quickstart will get you up and running with Stormpath in about 7 minutes and give you a good initial feel for the Stormpath Node.js SDK.  During this quickstart, you will do the following:

 * Install the Stormpath SDK
 * Create an API Key that allows you to make REST API calls with Stormpath
 * Register an Application 
 * Create a User Account
 * Search for a User Account
 * Authenticate a User Account
 
Stormpath also can do a lot more (*like Groups, Multitenancy, Social
Integration, and Security workflows*) which you can learn more about at the end
of this quickstart.

Let's get started!

***

## Install Stormpath SDK

Navigate to a folder that will include the node app and run

    npm install stormpath --save

This will install the official Stormpath npm module and store the dependency in `package.json`.

***

## Get an API Key

All requests to the Stormpath must be authenticated with an API Key. To get an API key:

1. If you haven't already, [Sign up for Stormpath here](https://api.stormpath.com/register).  You'll be sent a verification email.
1. Click the link in the verification email. 
1. Log in to the [Stormpath Admin Console](https://api.stormpath.com).
1. In the top-right corner of the resulting page, visit **Settings** > **My Account**.
1. On the Account Details page, under **Security Credentials**, click **Create API Key**.

 This will generate your API Key and download it to your computer as an `apiKey.properties` file. If you open the file in a text editor, you will see something similar to the following:

        apiKey.id = 144JVZINOFEBNCMG9EXAMPLE
        apiKey.secret = lWxOiKqKNwJmSldbiSkEbkNjgh2uRSNAb+AEXAMPLE

***

##Configure your Node.js Application

Now that set up is complete, you can start building something.  One of the first things that you need to do is include `stormpath` module in your javascript, like so:

    var stormpath = require('stormpath');

Once this is done, you can initialize a Stormpath `client` based on an API Key ID and Secret.  

    //Generate a Stormpath client based on your API Key and Secret
    var apiKey = new stormpath.ApiKey('YOUR_API_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_API_KEY_SECRET');
    var client = new stormpath.Client({apiKey: apiKey});

A `client` instance is your starting point for all interactions with the Stormpath API - once you have a Client instance, you can do everything else. 

## Register Your Application with Stormpath

Before you can store user accounts you'll need to have an `Application` and
`Directory` in Stormpath.  An Application is just Stormpathâ€™s term for a
project, and a Directory is a collection of unique user accounts.

Applications and Directories are decoupled, so you can share Directories
across your Applications.  This is useful for more complex authentication
scenarios (*like single sign on*).

You can create an Application and Directory together for convenience:

    //Some application properties
    var app = {
      name: 'My Awesome App',
      description: 'No, Seriously. It\'s Awesome!'
    };

    //Create the App
    client.createApplication(app, {createDirectory: true} ,function (err, createdApp){
          if (err) throw err;
          app = createdApp;
		  console.log("Application successfully created");
    });

The code above will create a new Application, then create a new Directory of the
same name (*if your Application is named "test" your Directory will be named
"test Directory"*).  The new Directory will then be bound to your Application,
so that all new users created in your Application will be stored in this
Directory.

## Create a User Account
Now that we've created an Application, let's create a user Account!  To do
this, you'll need to use your application (*created in the previous step*):

    var account = {
        givenName: 'Joe',
        surname: 'Stormtrooper',
		username: 'tk455',
        email:'stormtrooper@stormpath.com',
        password:'Changeme1',
        customData: {
            favoriteColor: 'White'
        }
    }

    //Create the account
    app.createAccount(account, function(err, account){
        if (err) throw err;
		console.log("Account successfully created");
    });

Stormpath Accounts have several basic fields (`given_name`, `surname`, `email`,
etc...), but also support variable JSON data through the `custom_data` field.

{% docs note %}
The required fields are: `given_name`, `surname`, `email`, and `password`.
{% enddocs %}

## Search for a User Account

Finding user Accounts is also simple.  You can search for Accounts by field:

    app.getAccounts({email:'stormtropper@stormpath.com'}, function(err, accounts){
        if (err) throw err;
        accounts.each(function (err, account, index){
            console.log("Found the user!  Here are the details: \n" + account);
        });
    });

You can also use wild cards such as `{'email': '*@stormpath.com'}` to return
all accounts with a stormpath.com domain.

## Authenticate a User 
Authenticating users is equally simple:

    app.authenticateAccount({
        username:'tk455',
        password:'Changeme1'
    }, function(err, result){
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("User successfully authenticated!");
    });

If the authentication request is successful, an `Account` resource will be
returned.
