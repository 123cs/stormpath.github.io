Quickstart
==========


This quickstart demonstrates the fastest way to enable Stormpath in a Spring Cloud Zuul gateway / reverse proxy.
It should take about 5 minutes start to finish.  Let's get started!

Add the |project|
-----------------

.. _dependency-jar:


This step allows you to enable Stormpath in a Spring Cloud Zuul gateway project with *very minimal* configuration.
It includes Stormpath Spring Security, Stormpath Spring WebMVC and Stormpath Thymeleaf templates.

Using your favorite dependency resolution build tool like Maven or Gradle, add the ``stormpath-zuul-spring-cloud-starter-1.2.2.jar`` to your project dependencies. For example:

**Maven**:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.stormpath.spring</groupId>
        <artifactId>stormpath-zuul-spring-cloud-starter</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.2</version>
    </dependency>

**Gradle**:

.. code-block:: groovy

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.stormpath.spring:stormpath-zuul-spring-cloud-starter:1.2.2'
    }

That's it!  Stormpath is now enabled in your Spring Cloud Zuul gateway!



Spring Security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |project| assumes Spring Security will be used to secure your gateway by default.  To ensure this
works correctly, you will need a Spring Security configuration class and apply the ``stormpath()`` hook:

.. code-block:: java
    :emphasize-lines: 7

    import static com.stormpath.spring.config.StormpathWebSecurityConfigurer.stormpath;

    @Configuration
    public class SpringSecurityWebAppConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http.apply(stormpath());
        }
    }

Without this, you will see a browser popup prompting for authentication, which is the default basic authentication behavior for Spring Security.

Also, by default, all paths are locked down with Spring Security. Stormpath's Spring Security integration follows this idiomatic behavior.

Disabling Spring Security
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you do not want to use Spring Security, do not add the ``SpringSecurityWebAppConfig`` class shown above (or just comment out the ``http.apply(stormpath())`` line if you do not want to remove the class).  Also set the following two config properties:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # disable Stormpath's Spring Security support:
   stormpath:
     spring:
       security:
         enabled: false

   # disable Spring Security entirely:
   security:
     basic:
       enabled: false




Configure Zuul
--------------

.. include:: config-zuul.rst.inc


Try it!
-------

If you followed the steps above you will now have fully functional registration, login, logout, forgot password workflows, api authentication and more active on your site!


Don’t believe it? Try it!

#. Start up your Stormpath-enabled Spring Cloud Gateway project, which will run on port 8000 ('localhost eight thousand')
#. Start up your web application that 'sits behind' the gateway, running on port 8080 ('localhost eighty eighty')

Then:

* Navigate to ``http://localhost:8000/register``. You will see a registration page. Go ahead and enter some information. You should be able to create a user account. Once you’ve created a user account, you’ll be automatically logged in, then redirected back to the root URL (``/`` by default).
* Submit a ``POST`` (not a ``GET``) to ``http://localhost:8000/logout``. You will be logged out of your account and then redirected back to ``/login`` by default.  You can learn more about ``POST`` for logout on the :ref:`Logout <logout>` page.
* After logging out, navigate to ``http://localhost:8000/login``. On the lower-right, click the **Forgot Password?** link, and you'll be shown a form to enter your email.  Enter in your email address and it will send you an email.  Wait for the email and click the link and you'll be able to set a new password!


Wasn't that easy?!

.. note::

  You probably noticed that you couldn't register a user account without specifying a sufficiently strong password.
  This is because, by default, Stormpath enforces certain password strength rules.

  If you'd like to change these password strength rules, you can do so easily by visiting the `Stormpath Admin Console`_,
  navigating to your your application's user ``Directory``, and then changing the "Password Strength Policy".

Any Problems?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Did you experience any problems with this quickstart?  It might not have worked perfectly for you if:


* you have more than one Application registered with Stormpath.  If this is the case, you'll need to configure your
  gateway's Stormpath ``href``, found in the admin console. Once you get the ``href``, add the following to your
  gateway's Spring Boot application properties or yaml file (where ``YOUR_APPLICATION_ID`` is your gateway's
  actual Stormpath Application ID):

  .. code-block:: yaml

     stormpath:
       application:
         href: 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID'

* your gateway already uses web frameworks that make heavy use of servlet filters, like Spring Security or
  Apache Shiro. These could cause filter ordering conflicts, but the fix is easy - you just need to specify the
  specific order where you want the Stormpath filter relative to other filters.  You do this by adding the following
  to your gateway's Spring Boot application properties (where ``preferred_value`` is your preferred integer value):

  .. code-block:: yaml

     stormpath:
       web:
         stormpathFilter:
           order: preferred_value #must be an integer

  By default, the ``StormpathFilter`` is ordered as ``Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE``, but if you have multiple
  filters with that same order value, you might have to change the order of the other filters as well.


* you're using the ``spring-boot-starter-parent`` as a ``parent`` and you are getting errors related to Spring
  Security. The Stormpath starter relies on Spring Security 4.1.x. The current release at the time of this writing
  of the ``spring-boot-starter-parent`` is 1.4.0 and it also relies on Spring Security 4.1.x. Prior versions of
  the ``spring-boot-starter-parent`` rely on Spring Security 3.2.x. Our first recommendation is to use the latest
  version of the ``spring-boot-starter-parent``. However, if you must use earlier versions, there is a simple
  solution to this, which is to override the Spring Security version in your ``pom.xml``

  .. code-block:: xml
     :emphasize-lines: 18

Next Steps
----------

That was just a little example of how much functionality is ready right out of the box.  You get so much more, like:

* View customization with your own look and feel
* Internationalization (i18n) for all views
* Token authentication for Javascript Single Page Applications (SPAs) and mobile clients like those on iOS and Android.
* Account email verification (verify an email address is valid before enabling a user account)
* Secure CSRF protection on views with forms
* Events to react to registration, login, logout, etc
* Session-free (stateless) secure user account identification
* HTTP Basic and OAuth2 authentication
* and more!


Continue on to find out how to leverage this functionality and customize it for your own needs.
