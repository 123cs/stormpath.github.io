Quickstart
==========


This quickstart demonstrates the fastest way to enable Stormpath in a Spring web application.  It should take
about 5 minutes start to finish.  Let's get started!

Add the |project|
-----------------

.. _dependency-jar:


This step allows you to enable Stormpath in a Spring  web app with *very minimal* configuration.
It includes Stormpath Spring Security, Stormpath Spring WebMVC and Stormpath Thymeleaf templates.

Using your favorite dependency resolution build tool like Maven or Gradle, add the ``stormpath-spring-security-webmvc-1.5.1.jar`` to your project dependencies. For example:

**Maven**:

.. code-block:: xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.stormpath.spring</groupId>
        <artifactId>stormpath-spring-security-webmvc</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.1</version>
    </dependency>

**Gradle**:

.. code-block:: groovy

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.stormpath.spring:stormpath-spring-security-webmvc:1.5.1'
    }



Spring Security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |project| assumes Spring Security will be used to secure your application by default.


To ensure this works correctly, you will need a Spring Security configuration class and apply the ``stormpath()`` hook:

.. code-block:: java
    :emphasize-lines: 10

    @Configuration
    @ComponentScan
    @PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
    @EnableStormpathWebSecurity
    public class SpringSecurityWebAppConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        }
    }

Without this, you will see a browser popup prompting for authentication, which is the default basic authentication behavior for Spring Security.


By default, all paths are locked down with Spring Security. Stormpath's Spring Security integration follows this idiomatic behavior.

Disabling Spring Security
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you do not want to use our Spring Security integration, set the following config property:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # disable Stormpath's Spring Security support:
   stormpath:
     spring:
       security:
         enabled: false

.. note::

   Alternatively you can disable Spring Security for good by having the following property in your configuration file:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      # disable Spring Security altogether:
      security:
        basic:
          enabled: false

   This will disable Spring Security along with the Stormpath Spring Security integration.


That's it! You're ready to start using Stormpath in your Spring  web application!


Try it!
-------

If you followed the steps above you will now have fully functional registration, login, logout, forgot password workflows, api authentication and more active on your site!


Don’t believe it? Try it! Start up your web application, and we'll walk you through the basics:

* Navigate to ``/register``. You will see a registration page. Go ahead and enter some information. You should be able to create a user account. Once you’ve created a user account, you’ll be automatically logged in, then redirected back to the root URL (``/`` by default).
* Submit a ``POST`` (not a ``GET``) to ``/logout``. You will be logged out of your account and then redirected back to ``/login`` by default.  You can learn more about ``POST`` for logout on the :ref:`Logout <logout>` page.
* After logging out, navigate to ``/login``. On the lower-right, click the **Forgot Password?** link, and you'll be shown a form to enter your email.  Enter in your email address and it will send you an email.  Wait for the email and click the link and you'll be able to set a new password!


Wasn't that easy?!

.. note::

  You probably noticed that you couldn't register a user account without specifying a sufficiently strong password.
  This is because, by default, Stormpath enforces certain password strength rules.

  If you'd like to change these password strength rules, you can do so easily. Visit the `Stormpath Admin Console`_,
  navigate to your your application's user ``Directory``, and then choose the ``Password Policy`` tab on the ``Policies`` page.

Any Problems?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Did you experience any problems with this quickstart?  It might not have worked perfectly for you if:

* There might be some cases in which you want to completely turn Stormpath off. For example, if you do not have an ApiKey in
  your machine then Stormpath will simply not boot. In those scenarios you can add the following property in the configuration file:

  .. code-block:: properties

     stormpath.enabled = false


* you have more than one Application registered with Stormpath.  If this is the case, you'll need to configure your
  application's Stormpath ``href``, found in the admin console. Once you get the ``href``, add the following to your
  application's Spring  application properties or yaml file (where ``YOUR_APPLICATION_ID`` is your application's
  actual Stormpath Application ID):

  .. code-block:: yaml

     stormpath:
       application:
         href: 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID'

* your application already uses web frameworks that make heavy use of servlet filters, like Spring Security or
  Apache Shiro. These could cause filter ordering conflicts, but the fix is easy - you just need to specify the
  specific order where you want the Stormpath filter relative to other filters.  You do this by adding the following
  to your application's Spring  application properties (where ``preferred_value`` is your preferred integer value):

  .. code-block:: yaml

     stormpath:
       web:
         stormpathFilter:
           order: preferred_value #must be an integer

  Spring Security is ordered as ``0`` (which is its default) and the ``StormpathFilter`` is ordered as ``10`` by default.
  If you have multiple filters with that same order value, you might have to change the order of the other filters as well.

Next Steps
----------

That was just a little example of how much functionality is ready right out of the box.  You get so much more, like:

* View customization with your own look and feel
* Internationalization (i18n) for all views
* Token authentication for Javascript Single Page Applications (SPAs) and mobile clients like those on iOS and Android.
* Account email verification (verify an email address is valid before enabling a user account)
* Secure CSRF protection on views with forms
* Events to react to registration, login, logout, etc.
* Session-free (stateless) secure user account identification
* HTTP Basic and OAuth2 authentication
* and more!
