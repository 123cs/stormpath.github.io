Welcome to Stormpath's Java Quickstart!

This quickstart will get you up and running with Stormpath in about 7 minutes
and give you a good initial feel for the Stormpath Java SDK.  During this
quickstart, you will do the following:

 * Add the Stormpath SDK to your project.
 * Create an API Key that allows you to make REST API calls with Stormpath.
 * Register an Application.
 * Create a User Account.
 * Search for a User Account.
 * Authenticate a User Account.

Stormpath also can do a lot more (*like Groups, Multitenancy, Social
Integration, and Security workflows*) which you can learn more about at the end
of this quickstart.

**TIP**:
This is a generic Java quickstart.  If you are building a web app deployed to a servlet container like Tomcat or Jetty, you might also find the [Stormpath Servlet Plugin Quickstart](https://docs.stormpath.com/java/servlet-plugin/) helpful.

Let's get started!

***

## Add the Stormpath SDK

Add the [Stormpath Java SDK](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-java) .jars to your application using Maven, Ant+Ivy, Grails, SBT, or whichever Maven Repository-compatible tool you prefer:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.stormpath.sdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>stormpath-sdk-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.RC4</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.stormpath.sdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>stormpath-sdk-httpclient</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.RC4</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    <!-- This next runtime dependency is only necessary if you have
         a REST API and you want to secure it with OAuth: -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.stormpath.sdk</groupId>
        <artifactId>stormpath-sdk-oauth</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.RC4</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>

If you are not using a Maven Repository-compatable tool, follow these [instructions](/java/product-guide#appendix).

More information on different ways to configure and retrieve information from this file can be found in the [Client Builder](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-java/blob/master/api/src/main/java/com/stormpath/sdk/client/ClientBuilder.java) API documentation.

***

## Get an API Key

All requests to Stormpath must be authenticated with an API Key.

1. If you haven't already,
   [Sign up for Stormpath here](https://api.stormpath.com/register).  You'll
   be sent a verification email.

2. Click the link in the verification email.

3. Log in to the [Stormpath Admin Console](https://api.stormpath.com) using
   the email address and password you used to register with Stormpath.

4. Click the **Create API Key** or **Manage Existing Keys** button in the middle of the page.

5. Under **Security Credentials**, click **Create API Key**.

   This will generate your API Key and download it to your computer as an
   `apiKey.properties` file.  If you open the file in a text editor, you will
   see something similar to the following:

        apiKey.id = 144JVZINOF5EBNCMG9EXAMPLE
        apiKey.secret = lWxOiKqKPNwJmSldbiSkEbkNjgh2uRSNAb+AEXAMPLE

6. Save this file in a secure location, such as your home directory, in a
   hidden `.stormpath` directory. For example:

        $ mkdir ~/.stormpath
        $ mv ~/Downloads/apiKey.properties ~/.stormpath/

5. Change the file permissions to ensure only you can read this file.  For
   example:

        $ chmod go-rwx ~/.stormpath/apiKey.properties

The `apiKey.properties` file holds your API key information, and can be used to
easily authenticate with the Stormpath SDK.


***


## Create a Client

The first step to working with Stormpath is creating a Stormpath
[Client](/java/product-guide#client) using your `apiKey.properties` file.
The `Client` object is what allows you to communicate with Stormpath.

    import com.stormpath.sdk.client.Clients;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.client.Client;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.api.ApiKeys;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.api.ApiKey;

    String path = System.getProperty("user.home") + "/.stormpath/apiKey.properties";

	ApiKey apiKey = ApiKeys.builder().setFileLocation(path).build();
	Client client = Clients.builder().setApiKey(apiKey).build();

	//If using Google App Engine, you must use Basic authentication:
    //Client client = Clients.builder().setApiKey(apiKey)
	//    .setAuthenticationScheme(AuthenticationScheme.BASIC)
	//    .build();

The `client` instance is intended to be an application singleton.  You should
reuse this instance throughout your application code.  You *should not*
create multiple `Client` instances as it could negatively affect caching.


***


## Retrieve your Application

Before you can create user Accounts you'll need to retrieve your Stormpath
Application.  An Application in Stormpath is the same thing as a project. If
you're building a web app named "Lightsabers Galore", you'd want to name your
Stormpath Application "Lightsabers Galore" as well.  By default, your Stormpath
account will have an application already created for you to use.  We will use
this application for the quickstart.

You can retrieve your example `Application` using the client you created in the
previous step:

    import com.stormpath.sdk.tenant.*;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.application.*;

    Tenant tenant = client.getCurrentTenant();
    ApplicationList applications = tenant.getApplications(
            Applications.where(Applications.name().eqIgnoreCase("My Application"))
    );

    Application application = applications.iterator().next();

The code above will retrieve your `Application`, which we can use later to do stuff
like:

- Create user accounts.
- Log users into their account.
- etc.


***


## Create a User Account

Now that we've created an Application, let's create a user Account!  To do
this, you'll need to use your application (*created in the previous step*):

    import com.stormpath.sdk.account.*;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.application.*;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.directory.*;

    //Create the account object
    Account account = client.instantiate(Account.class);

    //Set the account properties
    account.setGivenName("Joe");
    account.setSurname("Stormtrooper");
    account.setUsername("tk421"); //optional, defaults to email if unset
    account.setEmail("tk421@stormpath.com");
    account.setPassword("Changeme1");
    CustomData customData = account.getCustomData();
    customData.put("favoriteColor", "white");

    //Create the account using the existing Application object
    application.createAccount(account);

Stormpath Accounts have several basic fields (`givenName`, `surname`, `email`,
etc...), but also support storing schema-less JSON data through the `customData`
field.  `customData` allows you to store any user profile information (*up to
10MB per user!*).

{% docs note %}
The required fields are: `givenName`, `surname`, `email`, and `password`.
{% enddocs %}

Once you've created an Account, you can access the Account's data by referencing
the attribute names, for instance:

    account.getGivenName();

	account.getCustomData().get("favoriteColor");


***


## Search for a User Account

Finding user Accounts is also simple.  You can search for Accounts by field:

	Map<String, Object> queryParams = new HashMap<String, Object>();
	queryParams.put("email", "tk421@stormpath.com");
	AccountList accounts = application.getAccounts(queryParams);


You can also use wild cards such as `("email", "*@stormpath.com")` to return
all accounts with a stormpath.com domain.

***


## Authenticate a User Account

Authenticating users is equally simple -- you can specify either a `username` or
`email` address, along with a `password`:

    import com.stormpath.sdk.application.*;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.account.*;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.authc.*;
    import com.stormpath.sdk.resource.ResourceException;
    ...

    //Capture the username and password, such as via an SSL-encrypted web HTML form. We'll just simulate a form lookup and use the values we used above:
    String usernameOrEmail = "tk421@stormpath.com";
    String rawPassword = "Changeme1";

    //Create an authentication request using the credentials
    AuthenticationRequest request = new UsernamePasswordRequest(usernameOrEmail, rawPassword);

    //Now let's authenticate the account with the application:
    try {
        AuthenticationResult result = application.authenticateAccount(request);
        Account account = result.getAccount();
    } catch (ResourceException ex) {
        System.out.println(ex.getStatus() + " " + ex.getMessage());
    }

## Other Things You Can Do with Stormpath

In addition to user registration and login, Stormpath can do a lot more!

- Create and manage user groups.
- Partition multi-tenant SaaS account data.
- Simplify social login with providers like Google and Facebook.
- Manage developer API keys and access tokens.
- Verify new users via email.
- Automatically provide secure password reset functionality.
- Centralize your user store across multiple applications.
- Plug into your favorite security framework (*like [Apache Shiro](/integrations/#sample-apps-java-container-jump) or [Spring Security](/integrations/#sample-apps-java-container-jump)*).
