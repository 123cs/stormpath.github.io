Welcome to Stormpath's PHP Quickstart!

This quickstart will get you up and running with Stormpath in about 7 minutes
and give you a good initial feel for the Stormpath PHP library.  During this
quickstart, you will do the following:

 * Install the Stormpath library.
 * Create an API Key that allows you to make REST API calls with Stormpath.
 * Register an Application.
 * Create a User Account.
 * Authenticate a User Account.

Stormpath also can do a lot more (*like Groups, Multitenancy, Social
Integration, and Security workflows*) which you can learn more about at the end
of this quickstart.

Let's get started!



***


## Install the Stormpath Library

{% docs note %}
Stormpath works with PHP *5.3* and higher.  This documentation covers version
*1.3.0.beta* of our PHP library.
{% enddocs %}

You can install [Stormpath](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-php) using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

1. Create a directory for testing Stormpath:
 

        $ mkdir ~/test
        $ cd ~/test

2. Create a `composer.json` file to specify the correct Stormpath library version required:

        {
          "require": {
            "stormpath/sdk": "1.3.*@beta"
          }
        }
	

3. If you still havenâ€™t, install composer:
  
	    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php	


4. Install the Stormpath PHP SDK on your application root using:

	    php composer.phar install


{% docs tip %}
If you are unable to use Composer, please refer to the [Library's Readme](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-php#download-the-source-code) for instructions on downloading the source code.
{% enddocs %}

## Get an API Key

All requests to Stormpath must be authenticated with an API Key.

1. If you haven't already,
   [Sign up for Stormpath here](https://api.stormpath.com/register).  You'll
   be sent a verification email.

2. Click the link in the verification email.

3. Log in to the [Stormpath Admin Console](https://api.stormpath.com) using
   the email address and password you used to register with Stormpath.

4. Click the **Create API Key** or **Manage Existing Keys** button in the middle of the page.

5. Under **Security Credentials**, click **Create API Key**.

   This will generate your API Key and download it to your computer as an
   `apiKey.properties` file.  If you open the file in a text editor, you will
   see something similar to the following:

        apiKey.id = 144JVZINOF5EBNCMG9EXAMPLE
        apiKey.secret = lWxOiKqKPNwJmSldbiSkEbkNjgh2uRSNAb+AEXAMPLE

6. Save this file in a secure location, such as your home directory, in a
   hidden `.stormpath` directory. For example:

        $ mkdir ~/.stormpath
        $ mv ~/Downloads/apiKey.properties ~/.stormpath/

5. Change the file permissions to ensure only you can read this file.  For
   example:

        $ chmod go-rwx ~/.stormpath/apiKey.properties

The `apiKey.properties` file holds your API key information, and can be used to
easily authentication with the Stormpath library.


***


## Create a Client

The first step to working with Stormpath is creating a Stormpath
`Client` using your `apiKey.properties` file.  The `Client` object is what
allows you to communicate with Stormpath.

First, open the PHP shell by running:

    $ php -a

Then, create a new Stormpath `Client` with the following code:

    require 'vendor/autoload.php';
    $apiKeyFile = $_SERVER['HOME'] .  '/.stormpath/apiKey.properties';
    \Stormpath\Client::$apiKeyFileLocation = $apiKeyFile;

The `Client` instance is an application singleton.  You should reuse this
instance throughout your application code.


***


## Retrieve your Application

Before you can create user Accounts you'll need to retrieve your Stormpath
Application.  An Application in Stormpath is the same thing as a project. If
you're building a web app named "Lightsabers Galore", you'd want to name your
Stormpath Application "Lightsabers Galore" as well.  By default, your Stormpath account will have an application already created for you to use.  We will use this application for the quickstart. 

You can retrieve your example `Application` using the client you created in the previous step:

    $apps = $client->tenant->applications;
    $apps->search = array('name' => 'My Application');
    $application = $apps->getIterator()->current();


The code above will retrieve your example `Application`, which we can use later to do stuff like:

- Create user accounts.
- Log users into their account.
- etc.

***


## Create a User Account

Now that we've created an Application, let's create a user `Account`!  To do
this, you'll need to use your `Application` (*created in the previous step*):

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::instantiate(
        array(
            'givenName' => 'Joe',
            'surname' => 'Stormtrooper',
            'username' => 'tk421',
            'email' => 'tk421@stormpath.com',
            'password' => 'Changeme1',
        )
    );
    $application->createAccount($account);

Stormpath Accounts have several basic fields (`given_name`, `surname`, `email`,
etc...).

{% docs note %}
The required fields are: `given_name`, `surname`, `email`, and `password`.
{% enddocs %}

Once you've created an Account, you can access the Account's data by referencing
the attribute names, for instance:

    echo "Hi, " . $account->givenName . " " . $account->surname . "\n";


***


## Authenticate a User Account

Authenticating users is equally simple -- you can specify either a `username` or
`email` address, along with a `password`:

    $authResult = $application->authenticate('tk421', 'Changeme1');
    $account = $authResult->account;
	echo $account->givenName . " " . $account->surname . " Successfully Authenticated \n";

    $authResult = $application->authenticate('tk421@stormpath.com', 'Changeme1');
    $account = $authResult->account;
	echo $account->givenName . " " . $account->surname . " Successfully Authenticated \n";

If the authentication request is successful, an `Account` resource will be
returned.

{% docs note %}
This is typically only done when a user logs into a web app -- we're just
showing this example to illustrate how it works.
{% enddocs %}
