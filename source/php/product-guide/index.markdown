---

Stormpath is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Stormpathâ€™s intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage and secure users and roles in any application.

To get started with the basics of Stormpath quickly, check out the [PHP Quickstart Guide](/php/quickstart/). For a more complete understanding and reference of the full Stormpath service, read on.

***

## What is Stormpath?

Stormpath is the first easy, secure user management and authentication service for developers.

Fast and intuitive to use, Stormpath enables plug-and-play security and accelerates application development on any platform.

Built for developers, it offers an easy API, open source SDKs, and an active community. The flexible cloud service can manage millions of users with a scalable pricing model that is ideal for projects of any size.

By offloading user management and authentication to Stormpath, developers can bring new applications to market faster, reduce development and operations costs, and protect their users with best-in-class security.

### Overview

![](/images/docs/Architecture.png "High-level Architecture")

Stormpath is a REST API service. You use a REST client (or one of our open-source language-specific SDKs) inside your application to communicate with the Stormpath API. Stormpath's API allows you to offload user management and authentication by helping you do the following:

* Account registration, complete with sending welcome emails
* Account email verification (send email -> user clicks a link -> their account is verified and they can login)
* Secure password storage with continuously updated cryptography best practices
* Password reset (send email -> user clicks a link -> sets new password -> account password encrypted and stored securely)
* Account login (aka authentication)
* Seamless integration with LDAP and Active Directory - you'll never have to worry about integrating your application with them again
* A complete administrative user interface to allow you to manage your applications, directories, accounts and groups
* And more...

When building your applications in the past, how much time have you spent writing some or all of this functionality?  It is quite a large amount of work, and this logic has nothing to do with why you're writing your application!  But you need it, and you need it to be secure.

By offloading all of this effort to Stormpath, a service with deep security roots, you can quickly get back to writing your actual application and never worry about password attacks again.

<a class="anchor" name="core"></a>
### Core Concepts

Stormpath has five core concepts, and everything else in the Stormpath REST API exists to support them:

* Applications
* Directories
* Groups
* Accounts
* Tenants

These resources and their relationships are manageable by the REST API as described in this document, but you may also manage them via the [Stormpath Admin Console](https://api.stormpath.com) user interface.

**Applications**

An [Application](#applications) is a real-world software application that communicates with Stormpath to offload user management, authentication, and security workflows.  Each application that communicates with Stormpath is represented within Stormpath so you may manage its security needs.

You can assign one or more Directories and/or Groups to an Application.  Accounts within assigned directories and groups may login to the application.

**Directories**

A [Directory](#directories) is a top-level storage containers of Accounts and Groups.  A Directory also manages security policies (like password strength) for the Accounts it contains.  Stormpath supports two types of Directories: natively hosted 'Cloud' directories that originate in Stormpath and 'Mirror' directories that act as secure mirrors or replicas of existing directories outside of Stormpath, for example LDAP or Active Directory servers.

Directories can be used to cleanly manage segmented account populations - for example, you might use one Directory for company employees and another Directory for customers, each with its own security policies.

**Groups**

A [Group](#groups) is a uniquely named collection of Accounts within a Directory.  Each Group within a Directory must have a unique name and may contain Accounts within their own Directory.  Groups are mostly used for security and access control, often called Role-Based Access Control.  For example, you might only show a particular user interface button if an Account is in the 'Administrators' Group.

It might be helpful to note that Stormpath does not have an explicit Role concept - you use Stormpath Groups as Roles for Role-Based Access Control.

**Accounts**

An [Account](#accounts) is a unique identity within a Directory, with a unique username and/or email address. An account can log in to applications using either the email address or username associated with it. Accounts can represent end-users, but they can also be used to represent services, platforms, or any "entity" that needs to connect to a Stormpath-powered service.

**Tenants**

Stormpath is a [multi-tenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) software service. When you [sign up for Stormpath](https://api.stormpath.com/register), a private data 'space', called a `Tenant`, is created for you.  This private [tenant space](#tenants) contains all of the data you own, including your applications, directories, accounts and groups and more.  The `Tenant` concept is mostly 'behind the scenes' and you don't need to use it all that often, but sometimes it is necessary or useful to use directly.

### REST API

The Stormpath API offers authorized developers and administrators programmatic access to:

* Securely authenticate accounts.
* Create and manage accounts and adjust group membership.
* Manage directories.
* Manage groups.
* Initiate and process account automations.

For more detailed documentation on the Stormpath API, visit the [REST API Product Guide](/rest/product-guide/).

<a class="anchor" name="php-sdk"></a>
### PHP SDK

The Stormpath PHP SDK allows any PHP-based application to easily use the Stormpath user management service for all authentication and access control needs.  The PHP SDK can be found on [Github](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-php).

When you make SDK method calls, the calls are translated into HTTPS requests to the Stormpath REST+JSON API. The Stormpath PHP SDK therefore provides a clean object-oriented paradigm and alleviates the need to know how to make REST+JSON requests.

This SDK is compatible with PHP version `5.3` and higher.

Stormpath also offers guides and SDKs for [Ruby](/ruby/product-guide/), [Java](/java/product-guide/), and [Python](/python/product-guide/).

If you are using a language that does not yet have an SDK, you can use the REST API directly and refer to the [REST API Product Guide](/rest/product-guide/).

<a class="anchor" name="sdk-concepts"></a>
## SDK Concepts

Throughout this guide, code examples appear using the Stormpath PHP SDK.

Although knowing how the SDK is designed and how it works is not required to use it, knowing some of the design details will help you use it more efficiently and effectively.

### Client

The root entry point for SDK functionality is the `Client` instance. Using the client instance, you can access all tenant data, such as applications, directories, groups, and accounts.

The client can also have static properties configured if the user prefers to use the convenient static calls instead of instance calls.

<a class="anchor" name="preferred-config"></a>
#### Preferred Configuration

There are different ways to create a client instance to interact with your resources. The preferred mechanism is by reading a secure `apiKey.properties` file, where it is statically configured:

    $apiKeyFile = '/home/myhomedir/.stormpath/apiKey.properties';
    \Stormpath\Client::$apiKeyFileLocation = $apiKeyFile;

Or by creating a client instance using the `ClientBuilder` implementation:

	$builder = new \Stormpath\ClientBuilder();
	$client = $builder->setApiKeyFileLocation($apiKeyFile)->build();

This is heavily recommended if you have access to the file system.

<a class="anchor" name="custom-api-key-names"></a>
#### Custom Api Key Id and Secret names

You can even identify the names of the properties to use as the API key id and secret. For example, suppose your properties were:

    $foo = 'APIKEYID';
    $bar = 'APIKEYSECRET';

You could configure the Client with the following parameters:

    \Stormpath\Client::$apiKeyIdPropertyName = $foo;
    \Stormpath\Client::$apiKeySecretPropertyName = $bar;

Or by creating a client instance using the `ClientBuilder` implementation:

    $builder = new \Stormpath\ClientBuilder();
    $client = $builder->setApiKeyFileLocation($apiKeyFileLocation)->
                        setApiKeyIdPropertyName($foo)->
                        setApiKeySecretPropertyName($bar)->
                        build();

<a class="anchor" name="api-key-properties-string"></a>
#### API Key Properties String

The client can be configured by using the static `apiKeyProperties` property of the `\Stormpath\Client` class, which requires a valid PHP ini formatted string:

	$apiKeyProperties = "apiKey.id=APIKEYID\napiKey.secret=APIKEYSECRET";
    \Stormpath\Client::$apiKeyProperties = $apiKeyProperties;

Or by creating a client instance using the `ClientBuilder` implementation:

    $builder = new \Stormpath\ClientBuilder();
    $client = $builder->setApiKeyProperties($apiKeyProperties)->build();

Working with different property names (explained in the previous config instructions) also work with this scenario.

<a class="anchor" name="api-key-configuration"></a>
#### API Key Configuration

Another way to create a client is by creating an `ApiKey` instance with the API credentials and passing this instance to create the client instance:

	$apiKey = new \Stormpath\ApiKey('apiKeyId', 'apiKeySecret');
	$client = new \Stormpath\Client($apiKey);

{% docs warning %}
DO NOT specify your actual `apiKey.id` and `apiKey.secret` values in source code! They are secure values associated with a specific person. You should never expose these values to other people, not even other co-workers.
{% enddocs %}

Only use this technique if the values are obtained at runtime using a configuration mechanism that is not hard-coded into source code or easily-visible configuration files.

{% docs note %}
 Only if the `Client` is configured using the static properties, the static calls to resources will run successfully. If the `Client` is directly instantiated (using the `ClientBuilder` or the `Client` constructor), the `Client` instance must be used to start interactions with Stormpath. The code samples will show how to interact with Stormpath using both options.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="high-level-overview"></a>
### High-level Overview

The Stormpath SDK and the associated components reside and execute within your application at runtime. When making method calls on the SDK objects - particularly objects that represent REST data resources such as applications and accounts - the method call automatically triggers an HTTPS request to the Stormpath API server if necessary.

The HTTPS request allows you to program your application code to use regular PHP objects and alleviates you from worrying about the lower-level HTTP REST+JSON details and individual REST resource HTTP endpoints.

Here is how the communication works:<br>
![](/images/docs/SDKCommunicationFlow.png =700x "SDK Communication Flow")

In this example scenario, we have an existing SDK `account` resource instance, and we want its `directory`.

The request is broken down as follows:

1. The application attempts to acquire the account directory instance.
2. If the directory resource is not already in memory, the SDK creates a request to send to the Stormpath API server.
3. An HTTPS GET request is executed.
4. The Stormpath API server authenticates the request caller and looks up the directory resource.
5. The Stormpath API server responds with the JSON representation of the directory resource.
6. The Stormpath SDK transforms the JSON response into a directory object instance.
7. The directory instance is returned to the application.

<a class="anchor" name="detailed-design"></a>
### Detailed Design

The Stormpath SDK is designed with two primary design principles:

* **Composition**<br>
Although most SDK end users never need to customize the implementation behavior of an SDK, the SDK is pluggable meaning that the functionality can be customized by plugging in new implementations of relevant components. The SDK leans toward the [programming to interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_interface#Software_interfaces) and principles of [object composition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition) to support pluggability. Even if SDK end users never leverage this design, the design helps the Stormpath development team provide support and bug fixes without disrupting existing SDK usages.

* **Proxying**<br>
PHP instances representing REST resources use the [Proxy software design pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern) to intercept property access allowing the SDK implementation to automatically load the resource data or other referenced resources if necessary.

<a class="anchor" name="architectural-components"></a>
#### Architectural Components

The core component concepts of the SDK are as follows:<br>
![](/images/docs/ComponentArchitecture.png =700x430 "Stormpath SDK Component Architecture")

* **Client** is the root entry point for SDK functionality and accessing other SDK components, such as the `DataStore`. A client is constructed with a Stormpath API key which is required to communicate with the Stormpath API server. After it is constructed, the client delegates to an internal DataStore to do most of its work.
* **DataStore** is central to the Stormpath SDK. It is responsible for managing all PHP `resource` objects that represent Stormpath REST data resources such as applications, directories, and accounts. The DataStore is also responsible for translating calls made on PHP `resource` objects into REST requests to the Stormpath API server as necessary. It works between your application and the Stormpath API server.
	* **RequestExecutor** is an internal infrastructure component used by the `DataStore` to execute HTTP requests (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`) as necessary. When the DataStore needs to send a PHP `Resource` instance state to or query the server for resources, it delegates to the RequestExecutor to perform the actual HTTP requests. The Stormpath SDK default `RequestExecutor` implementation is `HttpClientRequestExecutor` which uses the [Guzzle Http library](http://guzzlephp.org/) to execute the raw requests and read the raw responses.
	* **MapMarshaller** is an internal infrastructure component used by the `DataStore` to convert JSON strings into PHP `Object` instances or the reverse. The map instances are used by the `ResourceFactory` to construct standard PHP objects representing REST resources. The Stormpath SDK default `MapMarshaller` uses the [JSON decode](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php).
	* **ResourceFactory** is an internal infrastructure component used by the `DataStore` to convert REST resource map data into standard PHP `resource` objects. The ResourceFactory uses Objects from `MapMarshaller` to construct the PHP resource instances.
	* **Resources** are standard PHP objects that have a 1-to-1 correlation with REST data resources in the Stormpath API server such as applications and directories. Applications directly use these `resource` objects for security needs, such as authenticating user accounts, creating groups and accounts, finding application accounts, assigning accounts to groups, and resetting passwords.

<a class="anchor" name="resources-proxying"></a>
### Resources and Proxying

When applications interact with a Stormpath SDK `resource` instance, they are really interacting with an intelligent data-aware proxy, not a simple object with some properties. Specifically, the `resource` instance is a proxy to the SDK client `DataStore` allowing resource instances to load data that might not yet be available.

For example, using the SDK Communication Flow diagram in the [high-level overview](#high-level-overview) section, assuming you have a reference to an `account` object - perhaps you have queried for it or you already have the account `href` and you want to load the `account` resource from the server:

Using the static Client configuration:

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/ACCOUNT_UID_HERE';
    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($href);

Using the Client instance:

	$account = $client->dataStore->getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT);

This retrieves the account at the specified `href` location using an HTTP `GET` request.

If you also want information about the `directory` owning that account, every account has a reference to the parent directory location in the JSON representation. For example:

	{
	  "givenName": "John",
	  "surname": "Smith",
	  ...
	  "directory": {
	      "href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/DIR_UID_HERE"
	  }
	  ...
	}

Notice the JSON `directory` property is only a link (pointer) to the directory; it does not contain any of the directory properties. The JSON shows we should be able to reference the `directory` property, and then reference the `href` property, and do another lookup (pseudo code):

Using the static Client configuration:

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/DIR_UID_HERE';
    $directory = \Stormpath\Resource\Directory::get($href);

Using the Client instance:

    $directory = $client->dataStore->getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::DIRECTORY);

This technique is cumbersome, verbose, and requires a lot of boilerplate code in your project. As such, SDK resources **automatically** execute the lookups for unloaded references for you using simple property navigation!

The previous lookup becomes:

	$directory = $account->directory;

If the directory already exists in memory because the `DataStore` has previously loaded it, the directory is immediately returned. However, if the directory is not present, the directory `href` is used to return the directory properties (the immediate data loaded) automatically for you. This technique is known as *lazy loading* which allows you to traverse entire object graphs automatically without requiring constant knowledge of `href` URLs.

<a class="anchor" name="error-handling"></a>
### Error Handling

Errors thrown from the server are translated to a [\Stormpath\Resource\ResourceError](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-php/blob/master/src/Stormpath/Resource/ResourceError.php). This applies to all requests to the Stormpath API endpoints.

For example, when getting the current tenant from the client you can catch any error that the request might produce as following:

	try {

	    $client->tenant;

	} catch (\Stormpath\Resource\ResourceError $re)
	{
	    echo 'Message: ' . $re->getMessage();
	    echo 'HTTP Status: ' . strval($re->getStatus());
	    echo 'Developer Message: ' . $re->getDeveloperMessage();
	    echo 'More Information: ' . $re->getMoreInfo();
	    echo 'Stormpath Error Code: ' . strval($re->getErrorCode());
	}

<a class="anchor" name="collections"></a>
### Collection Resources

A `Collection Resource` is a resource containing other resources. It is known as a Collection _Resource_ because it is itself a first class resource - it has its own attributes similar to any other resource in addition to the instances it contains.

If you want to interact with multiple resources, you must do so with a Collection Resource. Collection Resources also support additional behavior specific to collections, such as [pagination](#pagination), [sort ordering](#sorting), and [searching](#search).

**Collection Resource Attributes**

Attribute | Description | Type
:----- | :----- | :----
`href` | The fully qualified location URI of the Collection Resource. | String
<a id="collections-offset"></a>`offset`| The zero-based starting index in the entire collection of the first item to return. The default value is `0`. This is a [pagination](#pagination)-specific attribute. | Integer
<a id="collections-limit"></a>`limit` | The maximum number of collection items to return for a single request. Minimum value is `1`. The maximum value is `100` and the default value is `25`. This is a [pagination](#pagination)-specific attribute. | Integer
<a id="collections-page"></a>`currentPage` | An object containing the current page with an array of resources. The size of this array or resources can be less than the requested `limit`. For example, if the limit requested is greater than the maximum allowed or if the response represents the final page in the total collection and the item count of the final page is less than the `limit`. This is a [pagination](#pagination)-specific attribute. | Object

**Request**

To acquire a Collection Resource, use the getter of the containing parent resource, which is always in plural for collection resources.

For example, getting the tenant's children collection resources:

    $directories = $tenant->directories;
    $applications = $tenant->applications;

<a class="anchor" name="pagination"></a>
### Pagination


If a Collection Resource represents a large enough number of resource instances, it will not include them all in a single response. Instead a technique known as _pagination_ is automatically used by the SDK to return all resources when iterating over them.


<a class="anchor" name="pagination-query-parameters"></a>
#### Pagination Options

There are two pagination options that may be specified to control pagination:

- [offset](#collections-offset): The zero-based starting index in the entire collection of the first item to return. Default is <code>0</code>.
- [limit](#collections-limit): The maximum number of collection items to return for a single request. Minimum value is <code>1</code>. Maximum value is <code>100</code>. Default is <code>25</code>.

**Example Collection Resource Request**

An example request for a Collection Resource using pagination:

Using the setters that return the collection resource:

    foreach($tenant->applications->setOffset(10)->setLimit(40) as $app)
    {
        print $app->name;
    }

Or using the collection setters:

    $applications = $tenant->applications;
    $applications->offset = 10;
    $applications->limit = 40;
    foreach($applications as $app)
    {
        print $app->name;
    }

Alternatively, there is an `options` array in all collection resource getters that you can use to specify the pagination:

    $applications = $tenant->getApplications(array('offset' => 10, 'limit' => 40));
    foreach($applications as $app)
    {
        print $app->name;
    }

This example requests a tenant's `applications` Collection Resource from the server with page results starting at index 10 (the 11th element), with a maximum of 40 total elements.


<a class="anchor" name="sorting"></a>
### Sorting

A request for a Collection Resource can contain an optional `orderBy` query parameter. The query parameter value is a comma-delimited list of ordering statements.

For example, a sorted request might look like this:

    $collectionResource->order = new \Stormpath\Resource\Order(array('sortableAttributeName1', 'sortableAttributeName2','sortableAttributeNameN'), 'optionalAscendingOrDescendingStatement');

Each `orderStatement` is defined as follows:

`orderStatement ::= sortableAttributeName optionalAscendingOrDescendingStatement`

where:

- `sortableAttributeName` is the name of a sortable attribute of a resource in the `items` array. Sortable attributes are primitives (non-complex and non-link) attributes, such as integers and strings.
- `optionalAscendingOrDescendingStatement` is composed of the following:
    - a space character followed by:
    - the token `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending)

If the `optionalAscendingOrDescendingStatement` parameter is not included (the query parameter value is a sortable attribute name only), `asc` is assumed by default.

For example, to get all accounts of an application and order the results by `surname` ascending and then `givenName` descending:

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    $accounts->order = new \Stormpath\Resource\Order(array('surname', 'givenName'), 'desc');

Or specify the order by string:

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    $accounts->order = 'surname,givenName desc';

Alternatively, you can use the collection getter options to specify the order:

    $order = new \Stormpath\Resource\Order(array('surname', 'givenName'), 'desc');
    $accounts = $application->getAccounts(array('orderBy' => $order));

Or simply:

    $accounts = $application->getAccounts(array('orderBy' => 'surname,givenName desc'));

Now you can loop though the collection resource and get the results according to the specified order:

    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $acc->surname;
    }

Notice the `surname` order statement does not specify `asc` or `desc`, implying `asc` by default.

<a class="anchor" name="search"></a>
### Search

You can search for specific resources within a Collection Resource by using certain query parameters to specify your search criteria.

There are currently two different types of searches that might be performed: a generic [Filter](#search-filter)-based search and a more targeted [Attribute](#search-attribute)-based search. Both options support result [ordering](#sorting), [pagination](#pagination), and [link expansion](#links-expansion).

{% docs note %}
Currently, a search request must be targeted at resources of the same type. For example, a search can be performed across accounts or groups, but not both at the same time. Because the Stormpath REST API always represents one or more resources of the same type as a Collection Resource, a search is always sent to a Collection Resource endpoint.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="search-filter"></a>
#### Filter Search

A filter search consists of specifying a search value on a Collection Resource, or a `q` option and a corresponding search value on a Collection Resource:

    $collectionResource->search = 'searchValue';

For example, to search across an application's accounts for any account that has a searchable attribute containing the text 'Joe':

    $search = new \Stormpath\Resource\Search();
    $search->filter = 'Joe';
    $accounts->search = $search;

Or simply:

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    $accounts->search = 'Joe';

Alternatively, you can use the collection getter options to specify the search:

    $accounts = $application->getAccounts(array('q' => 'Joe'));

Now you can loop through the collection resource and get the results according to the specified search:

    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $account->surname;
    }

**Matching Logic**

If the entered criteria, through a case-_insensitive_ comparison, exists within (or is equal to) any viewable attribute on an instance in the collection, that instance is included in the query results. Only instances visible to the current caller (owned by the caller's tenant), are returned in the query results.

For example, consider the following query:

    $accounts->search = 'Joe';

This returns all accounts where:

- Each account is owned by the caller's [tenant](#tenants)
- The account `givenName` equals or contains 'joe' (case insensitive) OR
- The account `surname` equals or contains 'joe' (case insensitive) OR
- The account `email` equals or contains 'joe' (case insensitive) OR
- ... etc ...

In other words, each attribute comparison is similar to a 'like' operation in traditional RDBMS contexts. For example, if SQL was used to execute the query, it might look like this:

    select * from my_tenant_accounts where
        (lower(givenName) like '%joe%' OR
         lower(surname) like '%joe%' OR
         lower(email) like '%joe%' OR ... );

<a class="anchor" name="search-attribute"></a>
#### Attribute Search

Attribute-based search is the ability to find resources based on full and partial matching of specific individual resource attributes:

    $collectionResource->search = array('anAttribute' => 'someValue',
                                        'anotherAttribute' => 'anotherValue');

For example, to search an application's accounts for an account with a `givenName` of `Joe`:

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    $accounts->search = array('givenName' => 'Joe');

Or, using the `Search` object;

    $search = new \Stormpath\Resource\Search();
    $accounts->search = $search->addEquals('givenName', 'Joe');

Alternatively, you can use the collection getter options to specify the search:

    $accounts = $application->getAccounts(array('givenName' => 'Joe'));

Now you can loop through the collection resource and get the results according to the specified search:

    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $account->surname;
    }

**Matching Logic**

Attribute-based queries use standard URI query parameters and function as follows:

- Each query parameter name is the same name of a searchable attribute on an instance in the [Collection Resource](#collections).
- A query parameter value triggers one of four types of matching criteria:
    - No asterisk at the beginning or end of the value indicates a direct case-insensitive match.
    - An asterisk only at the beginning of the value indicates that the case-insensitive value is at the end.
    - An asterisk only at the end of the value indicates that the case-insensitive value is at the beginning.
    - An asterisk at the end AND at the beginning of the value indicates the value is contained in the string.

For example, consider the following search:

    $accounts->search = array('givenName' => 'Joe',
                              'middleName' => '*aul',
                              'surname' => '*mit*',
                              'email' => 'joePaul*',
                              'status' => 'disabled');

Or using the `Search` object methods, where you don't need to specify the asterisks:

    $search = new \Stormpath\Resource\Search();

    $account->search = $search->addEquals('givenName', 'Joe')->
                                addEndsWith('middleName', 'aul')->
                                addMatchAnywhere('surname', 'mit')->
                                addStartsWith('email', 'joePaul')->
                                addEquals('status', 'disabled');

Now you can loop through the collection resource and get the results according to the specified search:

    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $account->surname;
    }

This returns all accounts where:

- Each account is owned by the caller [tenant](#tenants).
- The account `givenName` is equal to 'Joe' (case insensitive) AND

{% docs note %}
For resources with a `status` attribute, status query values **must be the exact value**. For example, `enabled` or `disabled` must be passed and fragments such as `ena`, `dis`, `bled` are not acceptable.

### Link Expansion

When requesting a resource you might want the Stormpath API server to return not only that resource, but also one or more of its linked resources. Link expansion allows you to retrieve related resources in a single request to the server instead of having to issue multiple separate requests.

#### `expand` Query Parameter

For example, to retrieve an account including its parent directory information, instead of issuing two requests (one for the account and another for its directory) add an `expand` query parameter with a value of `directory` to the resource URI.

To better illustrate this, we will use an example using a raw REST API call and then we will explain how to get the same result using the PHP SDK.

Request:

    curl -u $API_KEY_ID:$API_KEY_SECRET \
         -H "Accept: application/json" \
         "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID?expand=directory"

Response:

    {
        "href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/ZugcG3JHQFOTKGEXAMPLE",
        "username": "lonestarr",
        "email": "lonestarr@druidia.com",
        "fullName": "Lonestarr Schwartz",
        "givenName": "Lonestarr",
        "middleName": "",
        "surname": "Schwartz",
        "status": "ENABLED",
        "emailVerificationToken": null,
        "groups": {
            "href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/ZugcG3JHQFOTKGEXAMPLE/groups"
        },
        "groupMemberships": {
            "href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/ZugcG3JHQFOTKGEXAMPLE/groupMemberships"
        },
        "directory": {
            "href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/S2HZc7gXTumVYEXAMPLE",
            "name": "Spaceballs",
            "description": "",
            "status": "ENABLED",
            "accounts": {
                "href":"https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/S2HZc7gXTumVYEXAMPLE/accounts"
            },
            "groups": {
                "href":"https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/S2HZc7gXTumVYEXAMPLE/groups"
            },
            "tenant":{
                "href":"https://api.stormpath.com/v1/tenants/wGbGaSNuTUix9EXAMPLE"
            }
        },
        "tenant": {
            "href": "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/tenants/wGbGaSNuTUix9EXAMPLE"
        }
    }

Notice that the account's `directory` attribute is no longer a link; it has been _expanded_ in-line and included in the response body.

You can use this technique to reduce the number of round-trip communication requests to Stormpath API server, enhancing the performance of your application.

In the PHP SDK you can do this the following way:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('directory');
    $accountHref = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID';
    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

Or, if you are using a `Client` instance instead of the static `Client` configuration:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                          $expansion->toExpansionArray());

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'directory')`.

After this request, when you call the `directory` property of the `account` instance, the SDK won't have to call the server because the `directory` would have already been loaded.

#### Expandable Attributes

Most link attributes are expandable. Check the resource's specific documentation to see which of its link attributes are expandable.

#### Expansion Depth Limit

It is currently only possible to expand a resource's immediate links. It is not currently possible to expand links of links.

For example, it would not be possible to return an account with its directory expanded and also the directory's groups expanded as well. Link expansion is currently only possible one level 'deep'.

If you have a critical need of multi-depth expansion, please contact us at <support@stormpath.com> and submit a feature request.

#### Expanding Multiple Links

You can specify more than one link attribute by specifying a list of attribute names to expand.

For example, to expand the example account's `directory` and `tenant` links, execute the following request:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('directory')->addProperty('tenant');
    $accountHref = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID';

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This last call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, array('expand' => $expansion));

Or, if you are using a `Client` instance instead of the static `Client` configuration:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                          $expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                           array('expand' => $expansion));

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'directory,tenant')`.

After this request, when you call the `directory` or the `tenant` property of the `account` instance, the SDK won't have to call the server because those properties would have already been loaded.

#### Expanding Collection Links

It is possible to expand links to Collection Resources as well.  You can additionally provide pagination parameters to control the paged output of the expanded collection.

For example, to expand the above account's groups (starting at the first group - index 0) and limiting to 10 results total, you can specify the `groups` attribute name followed by an array with `offset` and/or `limit` parameters with their corresponding values. For example:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('groups', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 10));
    $accountHref = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID';

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This last call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, array('expand' => $expansion));

Or, if you are using a `Client` instance instead of the static `Client` configuration:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                          $expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                           array('expand' => $expansion));

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'groups(offset:0,limit:10)')`.

After this request, when you call the `groups` property of the `account` instance, the SDK won't have to call the server because the `groups` collection resource would have already been loaded.

{% docs note %}
If you construct the expansion array yourself, instead of using the `Expansion` object, you need to consider that if you specify parenthesis for a collection expansion, you **must** specify an `offset` value or a `limit` value or both. Parenthesis without an `offset` or `limit` is a query syntax error and should be fixed. For example, `array('expand' => 'groups()')` is invalid and should be changed to only `array('expand' => 'groups')`.
{% enddocs %}

If you expand a Collection Resource and you do not specify an offset or limit (for example `array('expand' => 'groups')`), the default [pagination](#pagination) values are used automatically.

#### Expanding Collection Resources

It is also possible to expand properties of Collection Resources when you are directly requesting them. For example, to expand the directory of all the groups of an account.

Setting an `Expansion` object to the collection resource:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('directory');
    $groups = $account->groups;
    $groups->expansion = $expansion;

Or, setting the expansion using the `options` array:

    $groups = $account->getGroups($expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $groups = $account->getGroups(array('expand' => $expansion));

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'directory')`;

Now you can loop through the collection resource and get the results according to the specified expansion:

    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->directory->name;
    }

After this request, when you call the `directory` property of each `group` instance of the `groups` collection resource, the SDK won't have to call the server because the `directory` would have already been loaded.

#### Expansion Combinations

Finally, it should be noted that you can expand both standard (non-collection) links and collection links in the same `expand` directive. For example:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('groups', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 10))->
                addProperty('directory');

    $accountHref = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID';

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This last call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, array('expand' => $expansion));

Or, if you are using a `Client` instance instead of the static `Client` configuration:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                          $expansion->toExpansionArray());

    // This call could have also been made by specifying the expansion object in the options array:

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               getResource($accountHref,
                          \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                           array('expand' => $expansion));

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'groups(offset:0,limit:10)'),directory`.

After this request, when you call the `directory` or `groups` property of the `account` instance, the SDK won't have to call the server because those properties would have already been loaded.

You can combine the two techniques to more precisely customize your desired output.

<a class="anchor" name="tenants"></a>
## Tenants

Stormpath is a [multi-tenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) software service. When you [sign up for Stormpath](https://api.stormpath.com/register), a private data 'space' is created for you.  This space is represented as a `Tenant` resource in the Stormpath REST API.

It might help to think of a tenant as a Stormpath customer.  As a Stormpath tenant (customer), you own your `Tenant` resource and everything in it - applications, directories, accounts, groups, and so on.

In the Stormpath REST API specifically, your `Tenant` resource can be thought of as your global starting point.  You can access everything in your Tenant space by accessing your Tenant resource first and then interacting with its other linked resources (applications collection, directories collection, etc).

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource"></a>
### Tenant Resource

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-class"></a>
#### Resource Class

    \Stormpath\Resource\Tenant

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-attributes"></a>
#### Tenant Resource Attributes

Attribute | Description | Type | Valid Value
:----- | :----- | :---- | :----
<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-href"></a>`href` | The tenant resource's fully qualified URL. | String | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-name"></a>`name` | The name of the tenant. Unique across all tenants. | String | 1 < N <= 255 characters
<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-key"></a>`key` | Human readable tenant key. Unique across all tenants. | String | 1 < N <= 63 characters, no whitespace, lower-case a-z and dash '-' characters only, cannot start or end with a dash '-' character.
<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-applications"></a>`applications` | A link to the tenant's applications. | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="tenant-resource-directories"></a>`directories` | A link to the tenant's directories. | link | <span>--</span>

For Tenants, you can:

* [Retrieve a tenant](#tenant-retrieve)
* [Access a tenant's applications](#tenant-applications)
* [Access a tenant's directories](#tenant-directories)

<!-- TODO: We do not want users to update their Tenant information yet: * [Update (HTTP `POST`) a tenant resource](#UpdateTenantResource) -->

"Create" and "Delete" Tenant operations are currently not supported via the REST API. If you require this functionality, please email <support@stormpath.com> and request it.

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve A Tenant

You may only retrieve your own Tenant: every API Key that executes REST requests is associated with a Tenant, and the request caller may only retrieve the Tenant corresponding to the API Key used.

Because a REST caller can retrieve one and only one `Tenant` resource, it is often more convenient not to be concerned with the Tenant-specific URL is when performing a request, and instead use the Client tenant.

You can request the `current` Tenant resource, and the PHP SDK will automatically load the current tenant, by following the `302` redirect to the `Tenant` resource corresponding to the currently executing API caller. In other words, this call redirects the API caller to its own Tenant-specific REST resource URI, and the PHP SDK returns the concrete tenant information so the user doesn't have to worry about following the redirect.

**Example Request With The Static Client Configuration**

    $tenant = \Stormpath\Resource\Tenant::get();

**Example Request With A Client Instance**

    $tenant = $client->tenant;

<!-- TODO: re-enable after AM-1903 is complete:

### Update a Tenant {#tenant-update}

If you want to update one or more attribute of your `Tenant` resource, execute an HTTP `POST` request to the tenant URI.  Unspecified attribute are not changed. At least one attribute must be specified.

**Optional Attributes**

* [name](#Tname)

**Example Request**

    POST https://api.stormpath.com/v1/tenants/WpM9nyZ2TbaEzfbRvLk9KA

    {
      "name": "New Name"
    }

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-applications"></a>
### Tenant Applications

A `Tenant` has one or more [Applications](#applications) registered with Stormpath.  Each registered application may use Stormpath to simplify and automate its user management and authentication needs.

**Tenant Applications Collection Resource**

    $tenant->applications

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-applications-list"></a>
#### List Tenant Applications

You can list your tenant's applications by requesting your tenant's `applications` Collection Resource.  The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of tenant applications.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $applications = $tenant->applications;

    foreach($applications as $app)
    {
        print $app->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-applications-search"></a>
#### Search Tenant Applications

You may search for applications by requesting your tenant's `applications` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search).  Any matching applications within your tenant will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Application Attributes

The following application attributes are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `name`
* `description`
* `status`

In addition to the the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $applications = $tenant->applications;
    $applications->search = 'foo';
    $applications->offset = 0;
    $applications->limit = 50;
    $applications->order = 'name';

    foreach($applications as $app)
    {
        print $app->name;
    }

#### Working With Tenant Applications

Application resources supports the full suite of CRUD commands and other interactions.  Please see the [Applications section](#applications) for more information.

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-directories"></a>
### Tenant Directories

A `Tenant` has one or more [Directories](#directories) that contain accounts and groups.  Accounts may login to [applications](#applications) and groups can be used for access control within applications.

**Tenant Directories Collection Resource**

    $tenant->directories

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-directories-list"></a>
#### List Tenant Directories

You can list your tenant's directories by requesting your tenant's `directories` Collection Resource.  The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of your tenant's  directories.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example request**

    $directories = $tenant->directories;

    foreach($directories as $dir)
    {
        print $dir->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="tenant-directories-search"></a>
#### Search Tenant Directories

You may search for directories by requesting your tenant's `directories` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search).  Any matching directories with your tenant will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Directory Attributes

The following [directory attributes](#directory) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `name`
* `description`
* `status`

In addition to the the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $directories = $tenant->directories;
    $directories->search = 'foo';
    $directories->offset = 0;
    $directories->limit = 50;
    $directories->order = 'name';

    foreach($directories as $dir)
    {
        print $dir->name;
    }

#### Working With Tenant Directories

Directory resources support the full suite of CRUD commands and other interactions. Please see the [Directories section](#directories) for more information.

<a class="anchor" name="applications"></a>
## Applications

An application in Stormpath represents any real world piece of software that communicates with Stormpath to offload its user management and authentication needs.  The application can be anything that can make a REST API call - a web application that you are writing, a web server like Apache or Nginx, a Linux operating system, etc - basically anything that a user can login to.  A [tenant](#tenants) administrator can register one or more applications with Stormpath.

You control who may login to an application by assigning (or 'mapping') one or more directories or groups (generically called [account stores](#account-store-mappings) to an application.  The accounts in these associated directories or groups (again, _account stores_) collectively form the application's user base. These accounts are considered the application's users and they can login to the application.  Therefore, you can control who may login to an application by managing which [account stores](#account-store-mappings) are assigned to the application.

Even the Stormpath Admin Console and API is represented as an Application (named `Stormpath`), so you can control who has administrative access to your Stormpath [tenant](#tenants) by managing the `Stormpath` application's associated account stores.

<a class="anchor" name="application"></a>
### Application Resource

An individual `application` resource may be accessed via its Resource URI:

**Resource URI**

    /v1/applications/:applicationId

<a class="anchor" name="application-attributes"></a>
**Resource Attributes**

Attribute | Description | Type | Valid Value
:----- | :----- | :---- | :----
`href` | The application's fully qualified URL. | String | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-name"></a>`name` | The name of the application.  Must be unique across all applications within a [tenant](#tenants). | String | 1 <= N <= 255 characters. Unique within a tenant
<a class="anchor" name="application-description"></a>`description` | A description of the application. For example, providing the application's homepage URL might be helpful. | String | 0 <= N <= 4000 chars
<a class="anchor" name="application-status"></a>`status` | `enabled` applications allow accounts to login. `disabled` applications prevent accounts from logging in.  Newly created applications are `enabled` by default. | enum | `enabled`, `disabled`
<a class="anchor" name="application-tenant"></a>`tenant` | A link to the tenant that owns the application. | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-passwordResetTokens"></a>`passwordResetTokens` | A link to the application's password reset tokens collection, used in [password reset workflows](#application-password-reset). | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-loginAttempts"></a>`loginAttempts` | A link to to the application's login attempts collection.  When an account [attempts to login to an application](#workflow-login-attempt), the login attempt is submitted to this linked resource. | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-accounts-collection"></a>`accounts` | A link to all accounts that may login to the application.  This is an aggregate view of all accounts in the application's [assigned account stores](#account-store-mappings). | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-groups-attrib"></a>`groups` | A link to all groups that are accessible to the application for authorization (access control) needs.  This is an aggregate view of all groups in the application's [assigned account stores](#account-store-mappings). | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-accountStoreMappings"></a>`accountStoreMappings` | A link to the collection of all [account store mappings](#account-store-mappings) that represent the application.  The accounts and groups within the mapped account stores are obtainable by the `accounts` and `groups` links respectively. | link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="application-defaultAccountStoreMapping"></a>`defaultAccountStoreMapping` | A link to the account store mapping that reflects the [default account store](#account-store-mapping-default-account-store) where the application will store newly created accounts.  (A request to the `createAccount` method will result in storing the new account in the default account store). A `null` value disables the application from directly creating new accounts. | link | `null` or link
<a class="anchor" name="application-defaultGroupStoreMapping"></a>`defaultGroupStoreMapping` | A link to the account store mapping that reflects the [default group store](#account-store-mapping-default-group-store) where the application will store newly created groups.  (A request to the `createGroup` method will result in storing the new group in the default group store). A `null` value disables the application from directly creating new groups. | link | `null` or link

For Applications, you can:

* [Search for an application](#application-search)
* [Create an application](#application-create) (aka Register an Application with Stormpath)
* [Retrieve an application](#application-retrieve)
* [Update an application](#application-update)
    * [Enable an application](#application-enable) to allow logins
    * [Disable an application](#application-disable) to prevent logins
* [Delete an application](#application-delete)
* [List applications](#applications-list)
* [Search applications](#applications-search)
* [Work with application accounts](#application-accounts)
* [Work with application groups](#application-groups)
* [Work with application account store mappings](#application-account-store-mappings)

<a class="anchor" name="application-search"></a>
### Search for an Application

When communicating with the Stormpath REST API, you might need to search for an application.

For example, if you want to find an application named "My Application", you'll need to search the tenant for the "My Application" `application` resource:

**Example Request**

    $search = \Stormpath\Resource\Search();
    $search->addEquals('name', 'My Application');
    $applications = $tenant->applications;
    $applications->search = $search;

If you know the name exactly, you can use an [attribute search](#search-attribute) (e.g., `$search->addEquals('name', 'My Application')`) or, if you only know a small part, you can use a [filter search](#search-filter) (e.g., `$search->filter = 'My'`) to narrow the results.

<a class="anchor" name="application-create"></a>
### Create an Application (aka Register an Application with Stormpath)

For an application to communicate with Stormpath, you must register it first with Stormpath.

You register an application with Stormpath by creating a new `application` resource.  This is performed by submitting creation request on the `Application` class or on the `Tenant` instance.  This will create a new `Application` instance within the caller's tenant.

When you submit creation request, at least the `name` attribute must be specified, and it must be unique compared to all other applications in your tenant.  The `description` and `status` attributes are optional.

**Required Attribute**

* [name](#application-name) - must be unique compared to all other applications in your tenant.

**Optional Attributes**

* [description](#application-description)
* [status](#application-status) - if unspecified, the default is `enabled`.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $application = \Stormpath\Resource\Application::create(
      array('name' => 'My Application',
            'description' => 'My Application Description',
            'status' => 'enabled'));

**Example Request Using the Tenant Instance**

    $application = $client->
                   dataStore->
                   instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::APPLICATION);
    $application->name = 'My App';
    $application->description = 'App Description';
    $application->status = 'enabled';
    $tenant->createApplication($application);

{% docs note %}
By default, no accounts may login to a newly created application, and the new application cannot create accounts or groups immediately.  Applications must first be associated with one or more [account stores](#account-store-mappings) to enable this behavior.

Account store association however is mostly used for more complex applications.  If you want to create an application quickly and enable this additional behavior immediately, use the `createDirectory` option as discussed next.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="application-create-with-directory"></a>
#### Create an Application and Directory

The above Create Application POST request assumes you will later assign [account stores](#account-store-mappings) to the application so accounts may log in to the application.  This means that, by default, no one can login to a newly created application, nor can the application create new accounts or new groups directly.  For this additional functionality, one or more account stores must be associated with the application.

For many use cases, that is unnecessary work.  If you want to associate the Application with a new Directory automatically so you can start creating accounts and groups for the application immediately (without having to map other [account stores](#account-store-mappings), you can use the `createDirectory` option.

##### createDirectory=true

When sending the creation request, you can append a `'createDirectory' => true` option pair to the `options` array:

    $application = \Stormpath\Resource\Application::create(
      array('name' => 'My Application'),
      array('createDirectory' => true));

This request will:

1. Create the application.
2. Create a brand new Directory and automatically name the directory based on the application.  The generated name will reflect the new application's name as best as is possible, guaranteeing that it is unique compared to any of your existing directories.
3. Set the new Directory as the application's initial [account store](#account-store-mappings).
4. Enable the new Directory as the application's [default account store](#application-defaultAccountStoreMapping), ensuring any new accounts created directly by the application are stored in the new Directory.
5. Enable the new Directory as the application's [default group store](#application-defaultGroupStoreMapping), ensuring any new groups created directly by the application are stored in the new Directory.

This allows you to create accounts and groups directly via the application instance, without having to go through an account store mapping exercise.

##### createDirectory=a+custom+name

If you want to automatically create a Directory for your application, and you also want to manually specify the new Directory's name, instead of using a `true` value as the query parameter value, you can specify a String name instead:

    $application = \Stormpath\Resource\Application::create(
      array('name' => 'My Application'),
      array('createDirectory' => 'My App Directory'));

this request will:

1. Create the application.
2. Create a brand new Directory and automatically set the Directory's name to be your specified text value (e.g. 'My App Directory' in the example above). **HOWEVER**: If the directory name you choose is already in use by another of your existing directories, the request will fail.  You will either need to choose a different directory name or specify `true` and let Stormpath generate an unused unique name for you.
3. Set the new Directory as the application's initial [account store](#account-store-mappings).
4. Enable the new Directory as the application's [default account store](#application-defaultAccountStoreMapping), ensuring any new accounts created directly by the application are stored in the new Directory.
5. Enable the new Directory as the application's [default group store](#application-defaultGroupStoreMapping), ensuring any new groups created directly by the application are stored in the new Directory.

{% docs note %}
Automatically creating a directory when creating an application *does not* make that Directory private or restrict usage to only that application. The created directory is no different than any other directory. The `createDirectory` query parameter exists as a convenience to reduce the number of steps you would have had to execute otherwise.

If you delete an application, you must manually delete any auto-created directory yourself.  There is no shortcut to delete an auto-created directory.  This is to ensure safety in case the directory might be used by other applications.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="application-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve an Application

After you have created an application, you may retrieve its contents by requesting an application instance using its URL, returned in the `href` attribute.

If you don't have the application's URL, you can find it by [looking it up in the Stormpath Admin Console](/console/product-guide#!LocateAppURL) or by [searching your tenant's applications](#tenant-applications-search) for the application and then using its `href`.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/WpM9nyZ2TbaEzfbRvLk9KA';
    $application = \Stormpath\Resource\Application::get($href);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $application = $client->
                   dataStore->
                   getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::APPLICATION);

<a class="anchor" name="application-resources-expand"></a>
#### Expandable Resources

When retrieving an application, you can also retrieve one or more of its linked resources by [expanding them in-line](#links-expansion).

The following `Application` attributes are expandable:

* `tenant`
* `accounts`
* `groups`

Also, because `accounts` and `groups` are [Collection Resources](#collections) themselves, you can additionally control [pagination](#pagination) for either expanded collection.  For example:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('accounts', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 50))->addProperty('tenant');
    $application = \Stormpath\Resource\Application::get($href, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

Or

    $application = $client->
                   dataStore->
                   getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::APPLICATION, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

See the [Link Expansion](#links-expansion) section for more information on expanding link attributes.

<a class="anchor" name="application-update"></a>
### Update an Application

Set the properties to be updated on an `Application` instance that has an `href` and call the `save` method on it. Unspecified attributes are not changed, but at least one attribute must be specified.

**Updatable Application Attributes**

* [name](#application-name)
* [description](#application-description)
* [status](#application-status)

**Example Request**

    $application->description = "A new description.";
    $application->save();

<a class="anchor" name="application-enable"></a>
#### Enable an Application

Enabled applications allow associated accounts to login.  Disabled applications prevent logins.  When you create an application, it is `enabled` by default.

You can enable an application (and thereby allow associated accounts to login) by setting the `status` attribute to equal `ENABLED`.  For example:

**Example Request**

    $application->status = "enabled";
    $application->save();

<a class="anchor" name="application-disable"></a>
#### Disable an Application

Disabled applications prevent associated accounts from logging in.  When you create an application, it is `enabled` by default.

If you want to prevent logins for an application - for example, maybe you are undergoing maintenance and don't want accounts to login during this time - you can disable the application.

You can disable an application (and thereby prevent associated accounts from logging in) by setting the `status` attribute to equal `DISABLED`.  For example:

**Example Request**

    $application->status = "disabled";
    $application->save();

<a class="anchor" name="application-delete"></a>
### Delete an Application

You can delete an application ('unregister it') by calling the `delete` method on the application instance.

{% docs warning %}
Deleting an application completely erases the application and any of its related data from Stormpath.
{% enddocs %}

We recommend that you [disable an application](#application-disable) instead of deleting it if you anticipate that you might use the application again or if you want to retain its data for historical reference.

If you wish to delete an application:

**Example Request**

    $application->delete();

{% docs note %}
The `Stormpath` console application cannot be deleted.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="applications-list"></a>
### List Applications

You may list your tenant's applications as described in [List Tenant Applications](#tenant-applications-list).

<a class="anchor" name="applications-search"></a>
### Search Applications

You may search for applications as described in [Search Tenant Applications](#tenant-applications-search).

<a class="anchor" name="application-accounts"></a>
### Application Accounts

An application's account base is the collection of all [accounts](#accounts) that are accessible to that application.

You define an application's account base by assigning one or more [directories](#directories) (or [groups](#groups) within directories) to that application; by association, **any accounts within assigned directories (or groups) may login to the application**.

In this way, applications do not have _direct_ accounts of their own (accounts are 'owned' by [directories](#directories)) - accounts are instead _made available to_ applications based on associations with directories or groups within directories.

This is a powerful feature within Stormpath that allows you to segment account populations and control how accounts may use one or more applications.  For example, you might have an "Employees" directory and a "Customers" directory, which are two very different account populations that may or may not have access to the same applications.

**The aggregate collection of all accounts across all assigned directories or groups is the application's effective account base.**

However, many applications do not need this feature.  The most common use case in Stormpath is to create an application and a single directory solely for the purpose of that application's needs.  This is a totally valid approach and a good idea when starting with Stormpath.  However, rest assured that you have the flexibility to control your account populations in convenient ways as you expand to use Stormpath for any of your other applications. We'll cover directory and group associations for login more in-depth later.

**Application Accounts Collection Resource**

    $application->accounts

Applications additionally support the following account-specific functionality:

* [Register A New Account](#application-account-register)
* [Verify An Account's Email Address](#application-verify-email)
* [Log In (Authenticate) an Account](#application-account-authc)
* [Reset An Account's Password](#application-password-reset)
* [List an Application's Accounts](#application-accounts-list)
* [Search an Application's Accounts](#application-accounts-search)

<a class="anchor" name="application-account-register"></a>
#### Register a New Account

If your application wants to register a new account, you create a new `account` resource on the application instance.

Set the [account resource attributes](#account-resource) required and any additional ones you desire.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::instantiate(
      array('givenName' => 'Jean-Luc',
            'username' => 'jlpicard',
            'surname' => 'Picard',
            'email' => 'capt@enterprise.com',
            'password' => '4P@$$w0rd!'));

    $application->createAccount($account);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $account = $client->
               dataStore->
               instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT);

    $account->givenName = 'Jean-Luc';
    $account->username = 'jlpicard';
    $account->surname = 'Picard';
    $account->email = 'capt@enterprise.com';
    $account->password = '4P@$$w0rd!';

    $application->createAccount($account);

**How does this work?**

As we [said previously](#application-accounts), an Application does not 'own' accounts of its own - it has access to accounts in one or more directories and the directories actually own the accounts.  So how are we able to create a new account based on only the application?

The `createAccount` method is a convenience: when you create a new `account` resource, Stormpath will automatically route that creation request to a designated directory (or group) assigned to the Application.  The account is then persisted in that directory and then made immediately available to the application.

For most applications that have only a single assigned directory, the account is persisted in that directory immediately - the application developer does not even really need to know that Stormpath automates this.

However, applications that map more than one directory or group to define their account base have the option of specifying _which_ of those mapped locations should receive newly created accounts.  You must choose a default [new account location](#account-store-mapping-default-account-store).

<a class="anchor" name="application-welcome-email"></a>
##### Send a Welcome Email

Stormpath makes it easy to send a welcome email to the person associated with a newly created account.

When you create a new `account` resource, it is stored in a Directory. If the account is created in a directory with [Account Registration](#application-account-register) enabled, Stormpath will automatically send the welcome email to the account's email address on your behalf.

The email will be shown as coming from your email address, and you don't have to worry about email servers or how to send the email yourself.  You can customize the email template to say whatever you like.

By association then, if you add an account to your application programmatically or through the Stormpath Admin Console, and that account is stored in a directory with this feature enabled, Stormpath will send a welcome email to that account email address.

This workflow is disabled by default on Directories, but you can enable it easily in the Stormpath Admin Console UI. Refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!ManageWorkflowAutomation) for complete instructions.

<a class="anchor" name="application-verify-email"></a>
#### Verify An Account's Email Address

This workflow allows you to send a welcome email to a newly registered account and optionally verify that they own the email addressed used during registration.

The email verification workflow involves changes to an account at an application level, and as such, this workflow relies on the `account` resource as a starting point. For more information on working with these workflows via REST after they have already been configured, refer to the [Working With Accounts](#account-verify-email) section of this guide.
This workflow is disabled by default for accounts, but you can enable it easily in the Stormpath Admin Console UI. Refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!ManageWorkflowAutomation) for complete instructions.

{% docs note %}
Workflows are only available on cloud directories and only configurable using the Stormpath Admin Console. They are not currently configurable via the PHP SDK. Also, the Stormpath Administrator directory's automated workflows cannot be altered.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="application-account-authc"></a>
#### Log In (Authenticate) an Account

You may authenticate an account by calling the `authenticate` method of an application instance:

**Example Request**

    $result = $application->authenticate('usernameOrEmail', 'password');

If the login attempt is successful, an `AuthenticationResult` object is returned with a reference to the successfully authenticated account:

    $account = $result->account;

If the login attempt fails, a `400 Bad Request` is returned with an [error payload](#error-handling) explaining why the attempt failed:

**Example Login Attempt Failure Handling**

    try {

        $application->authenticate('johnsmith', 'badPassword');

    } catch (\Stormpath\Resource\ResourceError $re)
    {
        print $re->getStatus(); // Will output: 400
        print $re->getErrorCode(); // Will output: 400
        print $re->getMessage(); // Will output: "Invalid username or password."
        print $re->getDeveloperMessage(); // Will output: "Invalid username or password."
        print $re->getMoreInfo(); // Will output: "mailto:support@stormpath.com"
    }

<a class="anchor" name="application-password-reset"></a>
#### Reset An Account's Password

Stormpath has a comprehensive mechanism for secure password reset, as well.

##### Understanding The Password Reset Workflow

In Stormpath, the model used for password reset is based the common standard of sending an email to the address associated with the account. This email contains a verification link with a limited-life token. The end-user clicks this link and is redirected to either your own or a Strompath-owned password reset page where he or she can enter a new password.

{% docs note %}
At no point is the user shown, or does Stormpath have access to, the original password once it has been hashed during account creation. The only ways to change an account password through Stormpath once an account has been created are to allow the user to update it (without seeing the original value) after being authenticated or to use the password reset workflow.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="password-reset-base-URL"></a>
###### The Password Reset Base URL

It is also expected that the directory's Password Reset workflow's `Password Reset Base URL` has been set to a URL that will be processed by your own application web server. This URL should be free of any query parameters, as the Stormpath back-end will append on to the URL a parameter used to verify the email. If this URL is not set, a default Stormpath-branded page will appear which allows the user to complete the workflow.

{% docs note %}
The `Account Verification Base URL` defaults to a Stormpath API Sever URL which, while it is functional, is a Stormpath API server web page.  Because it will likely confuse your application end-users if they see a Stormpath web page, we strongly recommended that you specify a URL that points to your web application. Moreover, when specifying the Base URL, ensure it is a Base URL without query parameters
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="applications-account-password-reset"></a>
##### Trigger The Password Reset Email (Create A Token)

In order to reset an account's password, you'll need to create a `passwordResetToken`. In order to generate these tokens, you must retrieve an email address from the user and pass it along with the request.

Generating a `passwordResetToken` will inform Stormpath that you wish to initiate a password reset for a particular account. In addition, creating a new password reset token will automatically send a password reset email to the provided email address if and only if that address corresponds with an account listed in the application's [account stores](#account-store-mappings).

The application password reset tokens endpoint supports the password reset workflow for an account in the application's assigned [account stores](#account-store-mappings).

Creating a new password reset token automatically sends a password reset email to the destination email address if that address corresponds to an account listed in the application [account stores](#account-store-mappings).

A successful request sends a password reset email to the first discovered account associated with the corresponding application. The email recipient can then click a password reset URL in the email to reset their password in a web form.

The `sendPasswordResetEmail` method of an application instance must be called to send the email with the URL that includes the token:

**Example Request**

    $account = $application->sendPasswordResetEmail('john.smith@example.com');

A successfully returned account by this request indicates that a password reset email will be sent as soon as possible to the email specified.

If the password reset token creation fails, a `400 Bad Request` is returned with an [error payload](#error-handling) explaining why the attempt failed:

At this point, an email will be built using the [password reset base URL](#password-reset-base-URL) specified in the Stormpath Admin Console.

In a real-world implementation, you must build an end-point in your application that is designed to accept a request with the query string parameter "sptoken", which is the token value generated for the user. This token is then used to verify the reset request before updating the account accordingly.

<a class="anchor" name="password-reset-token-retrieve"></a>
##### Validate A Password Reset Request (Validate A Token)

Once you've successfully generated a token for a password request, you'll need to consume it to allow the user to change his or her password. To do this, Stormpath sends an email (that you can customize) to the user with a link and a verification token in the format that follows:

    http://yoursite.com/path/to/reset/page?sptoken=$TOKEN

Once the user clicks this browser, your controller should retrieve the token from the query string and check it against the Stormpath API.

Retrieving a token resource successfully using a call to the `verifyPasswordResetToken` method of an application instance indicates that the token is valid. Thus, to validate a token, you call to the `verifyPasswordResetToken` method and specify the token captured from the query string as the specific resource to request:

**Example Request**

    $account = $application->verifyPasswordResetToken('$TOKEN');

If the password reset token is invalid - it never existed or has expired - a `404 Not Found` response is returned.

After a successfully request with the query string token, you'll receive back an Account instance. Use this instance to set a new password. You do this just like any other [account update](#account-update), by specifying the attribute to update and calling the `save` method.

<a class="anchor" name="application-accounts-list"></a>
#### List Application Accounts

You can list your application's accounts by sending a request to your application's `accounts` Collection Resource.  The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of application accounts.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $account->surname;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="application-accounts-search"></a>
#### Search Application Accounts

You may search for directories by sending a request to your application's `accounts` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search).  Any matching directories with your tenant will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Account Attributes

The following [account attributes](#account-resource) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `givenName`
* `middleName`
* `surname`
* `username`
* `email`

In addition to the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    $accounts->search = 'foo';
    $accounts->offset = 0;
    $accounts->limit = 50;
    $accounts->order = 'givenName';

    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $account->surname;
    }

#### More Account Functionality

Account CRUD and other behavior that is not application-specific is covered in the main [Accounts section](#accounts).

<a class="anchor" name="application-groups"></a>
### Application Groups

An application's group base is the collection of all [groups](#groups) that are accessible to that application. This is an aggregate of all groups that are visible to the application, which will be an aggregate view of all the groups that belong to [directories](#directories) associated with that application.

You define an application's group base by assigning one or more [directories](#directories) to that application.

In this way, applications do not have _direct_ groups of their own (groups are 'owned' by [directories](#directories)) - groups are instead _made available to_ applications based on associations with directories.

This is a powerful feature within Stormpath that allows you to segment account populations and control how accounts may use one or more applications.  For example, you might have an "Admin" group and a "User" group, which would enable very different functionality in your application when a user is associated with one group or the other.

**The aggregate collection of all group's across all assigned directories is the application's effective group base.**

However, many applications do not need this feature.  The most common use case in Stormpath is to create an application and a single directory solely for the purpose of that application's needs.  This is a totally valid approach and a good idea when starting with Stormpath.  However, rest assured that you have the flexibility to control your account populations in convenient ways as you expand to use Stormpath for any of your other applications.

**Application Groups Collection Resource **

    $application->groups

Applications additionally support the following group-specific functionality:

* [Register A New Group](#application-groups-register)
* [List an Application's Groups](#application-groups-list)
* [Search an Application's Groups](#application-groups-search)

<a class="anchor" name="application-groups-register"></a>
#### Register a New Group

If your application wants to register a new group, you create a new `group` resource on the application instance.

Set the [group resource attributes](#group) required and any additional ones you desire.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $group = \Stormpath\Resource\Group::instantiate(
      array('name' => 'My Group',
            'description' => 'My Group Description'));

    $application->createGroup($group);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $group = $client->
             dataStore->
             instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::GROUP);

    $group->name = 'My Group';
    $group->description = 'My Group Description';

    $application->createGroup($group);

**How does this work?**

As we [said previously](#application-groups), an Application does not 'own' groups of its own - it has access to groups in one or more directories and the directories actually own the groups.  So how are we able to create a new group based on only the application?

The `createGroup` method is a convenience: when you create a new `group` resource, Stormpath will automatically route that creation request to a designated directory assigned to the Application.  The group is then persisted in that directory and then made immediately available to the application.

For most applications that have only a single assigned directory, the group is persisted in that directory immediately - the application developer does not even really need to know that Stormpath automates this.

However, applications that map more than one directory to define their group base have the option of specifying _which_ of those mapped locations should receive newly created groups.  You must choose a default [new group location](#account-store-mapping-default-group-store).

<a class="anchor" name="application-groups-list"></a>
#### List Application Groups

You can list your application's groups by sending a request to your application's `groups` Collection Resource.  The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of application groups.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $groups = $application->groups;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="application-groups-search"></a>
#### Search Application Groups

You may search for groups by sending a request to your application's `groups` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search).  Any matching groups within your application will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Group Attributes

The following [account attributes](#account-resource) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `name`
* `description`

In addition to the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $groups = $application->groups;
    $groups->search = 'foo';
    $groups->offset = 0;
    $groups->limit = 50;
    $groups->order = 'name';

    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

#### More Group Functionality

Group CRUD and other behavior that is not application-specific is covered in the main [Groups section](#groups).

<a class="anchor" name="application-account-store-mappings"></a>
### Application Account Store Mappings

An application's `accountStoreMappings` collection reflects all [groups](#groups) and [directories](#directories) that are assigned to that application for the purpose of providing accounts that may login to the application.  By managing these mappings, you can control which account populations may login to an application.  In this way, applications do not have _direct_ account stores of their own; account stores are instead _made available to_ applications based on associations with directories and groups.

This is a powerful feature within Stormpath that allows you to segment account populations and control how accounts may use one or more applications.  For example, the "Admin" user in an "Employees" directory vs. the "Admin" user in a "Customers" directory might require very different functionality in your application.

However, many applications do not need this feature.  The most common use case in Stormpath is to create an application and a single directory solely for the purpose of that application's needs.  This is a totally valid approach and a good idea when starting with Stormpath.  However, rest assured that you have the flexibility to control your account populations in convenient ways as you expand to use Stormpath for any of your other applications.

You define an application's account store mappings by creating, modifying or deleting [Account Store Mapping](#account-store-mappings) resources

**Application Account Store Mappings Collection Resource**

    $application->accountStoreMappings

<a class="anchor" name="application-account-store-mappings-list"></a>
#### List Application Account Store Mappings

You can list an application's assigned account stores by sending a request to the application's `accountStoreMappings` Collection Resource.  The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of application account store mappings.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $accountStoreMappings = $application->accountStoreMappings;
    foreach($accountStoreMappings as $asm)
    {
        print $asm->accountStore->name;
    }

## Account Store Mappings

_Account Store_ is a generic term for either a [Directory](#directories) or a [Group](#groups).  Directories and Groups are both are considered "account stores" because they both contain, or 'store', Accounts. An _Account Store Mapping_, then, is a relationship between an Account Store and an Application.

In Stormpath, you control who may login to an application by associating (or 'mapping') one or more account
stores to an application.  All of the accounts in the application's assigned account stores form the application's
effective _user base_; those accounts may login to the application.  If no account stores are assigned to an application, no accounts will be able to login to the application.

You control which account stores are assigned (mapped) to an application, and the order in which they are consulted during a login attempt, by manipulating an application's `AccountStoreMapping` resources.

<a class="anchor" name="workflow-login-attempt"></a>
**How Login Attempts Work**

When an account tries to login to an application, the application's assigned account stores are consulted _in the order that they are assigned to the application_.  When a matching account is discovered in a mapped account store, it is used to verify the authentication attempt and all subsequent account stores are ignored.  In other words, accounts are matched for application login based on a 'first match wins' policy.

Let's look at an example to illustrate this behavior.  Assume an application named Foo has been assigned (mapped) to two account stores, a 'Customers' directory and an 'Employees' directory, in that order.

The following flow chart shows what happens when an account attempts to login to the Foo application:

![Account Stores Diagram](/images/docs/LoginAttemptFlow.png =650x500 "Account Stores Diagram")

As you can see, Stormpath tries to find the account in the 'Customers' directory first because it has a higher _priority_ than the 'Employees' directory.  If not found, the 'Employees' directory is tried next as it has a lower priority.

You can assign multiple account stores to an application, but only one is required to enable login for an application.  Assigning multiple account stores (directories or groups) to an application, as well as configuring their priority, allows you precise control over the account populations that may login to your various applications.

### Account Store Mapping Resource

An individual `accountStoreMapping` resource may be accessed via its Resource URI:

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-url"></a>
**Resource URI**

    /v1/accountStoreMappings/:accountStoreMappingId

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-resource-attributes"></a>
**Resource Attributes**

Attribute | Description | Type | Valid Value
:----- | :----- | :---- | :----
`href` | The account store mapping resource's fully qualified location URI. | String | <span>--</span>
<a id="account-store-application"></a>`application` | A link to the mapping's Application. Required. | link | <span>--</span>
<a id="account-store-accountStore"></a>`accountStore` | A link to the mapping's account store (either a Group or Directory) containing accounts that may login to the `application`.  Required. | link | <span>--</span>
<a id="list-index"></a>`listIndex` | The order (priority) when the associated `accountStore` will be consulted by the `application` during an authentication attempt.  This is a zero-based index; an account store at `listIndex` of `0` will be consulted first (has the highest priority), followed the account store at `listIndex` `1` (next highest priority), etc.  Setting a negative value will default the value to `0`, placing it first in the list.  A `listIndex` of larger than the current list size will place the mapping at the end of the list and then default the value to `(list size - 1)`. | Integer | 0 <= N < list size
<a id="account-store-mapping-resource-is-default-account-store"></a>`isDefaultAccountStore` | A `true` value indicates that new accounts [created by the application](#application-account-register) will be automatically saved to the mapping's `accountStore`. A `false` value indicates that new accounts created by the application will not be saved to the `accountStore`. | boolean | `true`,`false`
<a id="account-store-mapping-resource-is-default-group-store"></a>`isDefaultGroupStore` | A `true` value indicates that new groups created by the `application` will be automatically saved to the mapping's `accountStore`. A `false` value indicates that new groups created by the application will not be saved to the `accountStore`. **This may only be set to `true` if the `accountStore` is a Directory.  Stormpath does not currently support Groups storing other Groups.** | boolean | `true`,`false`

For Account Store Mappings, you may:

* [Locate an account store mapping's REST URL](#account-store-mapping-url)
* [Create an account store mapping](#account-store-mapping-create)
* [Retrieve an account store mapping](#account-store-mapping-retrieve)
* [Update an account store mapping](#account-store-mapping-update)
    * [Set the login priority](#account-store-mapping-update-priority) of an assigned account store
    * [Set the default account store](#account-store-mapping-default-account-store) for new accounts created by an application
    * [Set the default group store](#account-store-mapping-default-group-store) for new groups created by an application
* [Delete an account store mapping](#account-store-mapping-delete)
* [List an application's assigned account stores](#account-store-mapping-list)

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-url"></a>
### Locate an Account Store Mapping's REST URL

You locate an Account Store Mapping's `href` by [listing an Application's associated Account Store Mappings](#application-account-store-mappings-list).  Within the list, find the `AccountStoreMapping` you need - it will have a unique `href` property.

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-create"></a>
### Create an Account Store Mapping

In order for accounts in a Directory or Group to be able to login to an application, you must associate or 'map' the Directory or Group to the Application.  You do this by creating a new `AccountStoreMapping` resource that references both the account store and application.

You do this by calling the `create` method on the `AccountStoreMapping` resource class, or by calling the `createAccountStoreMapping` on an `Application` instance. You must specify the application and the account store instances, both containing an `href` property, when creating the account store mapping.

**Required Attributes**

* [application](#account-store-application) (an instance)
* [accountStore](#account-store-accountStore) (an instance)

**Optional Attributes**

* [listIndex](#list-index)
* [isDefaultAccountStore](#account-store-mapping-resource-is-default-account-store) - if unspecified, the default is `false`
* [isDefaultGroupStore](#account-store-mapping-resource-is-default-group-store) - if unspecified, the default is `false`

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $accountStoreMapping = \Stormpath\Resource\AccountStoreMapping::create(
        array('accountStore' => $accountStore, // this could be an existing group or a directory
              'application' => $application,
              'isDefaultAccountStore' => true,
              'isDefaultGroupStore' => true,
              'listIndex' => 0)
        );

Or, creating it from an application instance:

    $accountStoreMapping = \Stormpath\Resource\AccountStoreMapping::instantiate(
        array('accountStore' => $accountStore, // this could be an existing group or a directory
              'isDefaultAccountStore' => true,
              'isDefaultGroupStore' => true,
              'listIndex' => 0)
        );

     $application->createAccountStoreMapping($accountStoreMapping);

Notice that when creating the account store mapping from an application we didn't need to specify the application when we called the static `instantiate` method of the `AccountStoreMapping` class.

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $accountStoreMapping = $client->
                         dataStore->
                         instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT_STORE_MAPPING);
    $accountStoreMapping->accountStore = $accountStore; // this could be an existing group or a directory
    $accountStoreMapping->defaultAccountStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->defaultGroupStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->listIndex = 0;
    $application->createAccountStoreMapping($accountStoreMapping);

You may use the response's `$accountStoreMapping` instance to further interact with your new `AccountStoreMapping` resource.

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve An Account Store Mapping

After you have created an account store mapping, you may retrieve its contents by sending a request to the static `get` method of the account store mapping class with the `href` attribute, or using a Client instance.

If you don't have the account store mapping's `href`, you can find it in the [application's account store mappings list](#application-account-store-mappings-list).

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accountStoreMappings/WpM9nyZ2TbayIfbRvLk9CO';
    $accountStoreMapping = \Stormpath\Resource\AccountStoreMapping::get($href);

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accountStoreMappings/WpM9nyZ2TbayIfbRvLk9CO';
    $accountStoreMapping = $client->
                           dataStore->
                           getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT_STORE_MAPPING);

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-resources-expand"></a>
#### Expandable Resources

When retrieving an Account Store Mapping, you can also retrieve one or more of its linked resources by [expanding them in-line](#links-expansion) using the expansion options.

The following `AccountStoreMapping` attributes are expandable:

* `accountStore`
* `application`

See the [Link Expansion](#links-expansion) section for more information on expanding link attributes.

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-update"></a>
### Update An Account Store Mapping

Call the `save` method on an accountStoreMapping when you want to change one or more specific application attributes. Unspecified attributes are not changed, but at least one attribute must be specified.

**Updatable Application Attributes**

* [listIndex](#list-index)
* [isDefaultAccountStore](#account-store-mapping-resource-is-default-account-store)
* [isDefaultGroupStore](#account-store-mapping-resource-is-default-group-store)

**Example Request**

    $accountStoreMapping->defaultAccountStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->save();

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-update-priority"></a>
#### Set the Login Priority of an Assigned Account Store

As we've [shown previously](#workflow-login-attempt), an account trying to login to an application will be matched to the application's account stores based on the list order they are assigned to the application.  The account store at list index 0 has the highest priority, the account store at list index 1 has the next highest priority, and so on.  When an account is discovered in an account store, the login attempt occurs and returns immediately.  All remaining account stores are not checked.

If you wish to change an account store's login priority for an application, you simply:

1. Find the `accountStoreMapping` resource in the application's `accountStoreMappings` [collection](#collections) that reflects the `accountStore` that you wish to re-prioritize.
2. Issue an update request to that `AccountStoreMapping`'s instance with a new `listIndex` value.

**Example Request**

For example, assume that an account store represented by mapping `$accountStoreMapping` has a list index of `0` (first in the list), and we wanted to lower its priority to `1` (second in the list):

    $accountStoreMapping->listIndex = 1;
    $accountStoreMapping->save();

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-default-account-store"></a>
#### Set The Default Account Store for new Application Accounts

Applications cannot store Accounts directly - Accounts are always stored in a Directory or Group.  Therefore, if you would like an application to be able to create new accounts, you must specify which of the application's associated account stores should store the application's newly created accounts.  This designated account store is called the application's _default account store_.

You specify an application's default account store by setting the AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultAccountStore` attribute to equal `true`.  You can do this when you create the `accountStoreMapping` resource.  Or if the resource has already been created:

1. Find the `accountStoreMapping` resource in the Application's `accountStoreMappings` [collection](#collections) that reflects the `accountStore` you wish to be the application's default account store.
2. Issue an update request to that AccountStoreMapping's instance with `defaultAccountStore` set to `true`.

**Example Request**

    $accountStoreMapping->defaultAccountStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->save();

Now, any time a new account is created from an application's `createAccount` method, the account will actually be created in the designated default account store.

**Directory vs Group?**

If the application's default account store is a:

* directory: the account will be created in the directory
* group: the account will be created in the group's directory first, then assigned to the group automatically.

{% docs note %}
Only one of an application's mapped account stores may be the default account store.

In addition, setting an AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultAccountStore` value to `true` will automatically set the application's other AccountStoreMappings' `isDefaultAccountStore` values to `false`. HOWEVER:

Lastly, note that setting an AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultAccountStore` value to `false` **WILL NOT** automatically set another AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultAccountStore` to `true`.  You are responsible for explicitly setting `isDefaultAccountStore` to `true` if you want the application to be able to create new accounts.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs warning %}
If none of the application's AccountStoreMappings are designated as the default account store, the application _WILL NOT_ be able to create new accounts.

Also note that Mirrored directories or groups within Mirrored directories are read-only; they cannot be set as an application's default account store.  Attempting to set `isDefaultAccountStore` to `true` on an AccountStoreMapping that reflects a mirrored directory or group will result in an error response.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-default-group-store"></a>
#### Set The Default Group Store for new Application Groups

Applications cannot store Groups directly - Groups are always stored in a Directory.  Therefore, if you would like an application to be able to create new groups, you must specify which of the application's associated account stores should store the application's newly created groups.  This designated store is called the application's _default group store_.

You specify an application's default group store by setting the `AccountStoreMapping`'s `isDefaultGroupStore` attribute to equal `true`.  You can do this when you create the `accountStoreMapping` resource, or if the resource has already been created:

1. Find the `accountStoreMapping` resource in the Application's `accountStoreMappings` [collection](#collections) that reflects the `accountStore` you wish to be the application's default group store.
2. Issue an update request to that `AccountStoreMapping`'s instance with `isDefaultGroupStore` set to `true`.

**Example Request**

    $accountStoreMapping->defaultGroupStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->save();

Now, any time a new group is created from an application's `createGroup` method, the group will actually be created in the designated default group store.

{% docs note %}
Only one of an application's mapped account stores may be the default group store.

Also, note that setting an AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultGroupStore` value to `true` will automatically set the application's other AccountStoreMappings' `isDefaultGroupStore` values to `false`. HOWEVER:

Lastly, setting an AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultGroupStore` value to `false` **WILL NOT** automatically set another AccountStoreMapping's `isDefaultGroupStore` to `true`.  You are responsible for explicitly setting `isDefaultGroupStore` to `true` if you want the application to be able to create new groups.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs warning %}

If no `AccountStoreMapping` is designated as the default group store, the application _WILL NOT_ be able to create new groups.

Also, note that Stormpath does not currently support storing groups within groups.  Therefore `isDefaultGroupStore` can only be set to `true` when the AccountStoreMapping's `accountStore` is a Directory.  Attempting to set `isDefaultGroupStore` to `true` on an AccountStoreMapping that reflects a group will result in an error response.

Lastly, note that mirrored directories are read-only; they cannot be set as an application's default group store. Attempting to set `isDefaultGroupStore` to `true` on an AccountStoreMapping that reflects a mirrored directory will result in an error response.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-delete"></a>
### Delete an Account Store Mapping

You remove an assigned account store from an application by deleting the `accountStoreMapping` resource that links the accountStore and the application together.  This removes the possibility of the accounts in the associated account store from being able to login to the application.

{% docs note %}
Deleting an `accountStoreMapping` resource *does not* delete either the account store or the application resources themselves - only the association between the two.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs warning %}
Deleting an account store mapping will remove the ability for accounts in the account store from authenticating with the application unless they are associated with an account store that is still mapped to the application. Be careful when removing mappings.

Also, note that if no `AccountStoreMapping` is designated as the default group store, the application _WILL NOT_ be able to create new groups.
{% enddocs %}

**Example Request**

For example, to delete the application-accountStore association we created in the above previous example:

    $accountStoreMapping->delete();

<a class="anchor" name="account-store-mapping-list"></a>
### List Account Store Mappings

You can list an applications's mapped account stores by issuing a request to the application's `accountStoreMappings` Collection Resource.

The response is a paginated list of `accountStoreMapping` resources.  You may use collection [pagination](#pagination) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $accountStoreMappings = $application->accountStoreMappings;
    foreach($accountStoreMappings as $asm)
    {
        print $asm->accountStore->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="directories"></a>
## Directories

A Directory is a top-level storage containers of Accounts and Groups. A Directory also manages security policies (like password strength) for the Accounts it contains. Stormpath supports two types of Directories:

1. Natively hosted â€˜Cloudâ€™ directories that originate in Stormpath and
2. â€˜Mirrorâ€™ directories that act as secure mirrors or replicas of existing directories outside of Stormpath, for example LDAP or Active Directory servers.

Directories can be used to cleanly manage segmented account populations.  For example, you might use one Directory for company employees and another Directory for customers, each with its own security policies.  You can [associate directories to applications](#account-store-mappings) (or groups within a directory) to allow its accounts to login to applications.

<a class="anchor" name="directory"></a>
### Directory Resource

An individual `directory` resource may be accessed via its Resource URI:

**Resource URI**

    /v1/directories/:directoryId

<a class="anchor" name="directory-attributes"></a>
**Resource Attributes**

Attribute | Description | Type | Valid Value
:----- | :----- | :---- | :----
`href` | The resource fully qualified location URI | String | <span>--</span>
<a id="directory-resource-name"></a>`name` | Name of the directory. Must be unique within a [tenant](#tenants). | String | 1 < N <= 255 characters
<a id="directory-resource-description"></a>`description` | The description of the directory. | String | 0 < N <= 1000 characters
<a id="directory-resource-status"></a>`status` | Enabled directories can be used as account stores for applications. Disabled directories cannot be used for login. | Enum | `enabled`,`disabled`
<a class="anchor" name="directory-resource-accounts"></a>`accounts` | A link to the accounts owned by the directory. | Link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="directory-resource-groups"></a>`groups` | A link to the groups owned by the directory. | Link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="directory-resource-tenant"></a>`tenant` | A link to the owning tenant. | Link | <span>--</span>

Within Stormpath, there are two types of directories you can implement:

* A <strong>Cloud</strong> directory, also known as Stormpath-managed directories, which are hosted by Stormpath and use the Stormpath data model to store account and group information. This is the default and most common type of directory in Stormpath.
* A <strong>Mirrored</strong> directory, which is a Stormpath-hosted directory populated with data pushed from your existing LDAP/AD directory using a Stormpath synchronization agent. All user management is done on your existing LDAP/AD directory, but the cloud mirror can be accessed through the Stormpath APIs on your modern applications.

    * Agent directories cannot be created using the API.
    * You can specify various LDAP/AD object and attribute settings of the specific LDAP/AD server for accounts and groups.
    * If the agent status is `Online`, but you are unable to see any data when browsing your LDAP/AD mapped directory, it is likely that your object and filters are configured incorrectly.

You can add as many directories of each type as you require. Changing group memberships, adding accounts, or deleting accounts in directories affects ALL applications to which the directories are mapped as [account stores](#account-store-mappings)</a>.

LDAP/AD accounts and groups are automatically deleted when:

* The backing object is deleted from the LDAP/AD directory service.
* The backing LDAP/AD object information no longer matches the account filter criteria configured for the agent.
* The LDAP/AD directory is deleted.

For directories, you can:

* [Locate a directory's REST URL](#locate-a-directorys-rest-url)
* [Create a directory](#directory-create)
    * [Create a cloud directory](#create-a-cloud-directory)
    * [Create a mirrored (LDAP) directory](#directories-mirrored)
    * [Associate directories with applications](#associate-directories-with-applications)
* [Retrieve a directory](#directory-retrieve)
* [Update a directory](#directory-update)
    * [Enable or disable a directory](#enable-or-disable-a-directory)
    * [Update agent configuration](#update-agent-configuration)
* [Delete a directory](#directory-delete)
* [List directories](#directory-list)
* [Search directories](#directory-search)
* [Work with directories](#work-with-directories)
    * [Enforce Account Password Restrictions](#directories-password-restrictions)
    * [Register A New Account](#directories-account-reg)
    * [Register A New Group](#directories-group-reg)
    * [Verify An Account's Email Address](#directories-verify-email)
    * [Reset An Account's Password](#directories-password-reset)
* [Work with directory groups](#directory-groups)
* [Work with directory accounts](#directory-accounts)

<a class="anchor" name="locate-a-directorys-rest-url"></a>
### Locate a Directory's REST URL

When communicating with the Stormpath REST API, you might need to reference a directory directly using its REST URL or `href`.

There are multiple ways to find a directory `href` depending on what information you have available:

* Retrieve a full list of directories from the tenant
* Retrieve an application's `accountStoreMappings` and extract the directories iteratively
* Retrieve an account and determine its directory

In all cases, the process is fundamentally the same. Consider the first case as example. In order to locate a directory's `href`, you'll need to first search the tenant for the specific directory using some information that you have available. If you want to find the `href` for a directory with the name "My Directory", you'll need to search the tenant for the directory object:

**Example Request**

    $directories = $tenant->directories;
    $directory = false;
    foreach($directories as $dir)
    {
        if ($dir->name == "My Directory")
        {
            $directory = $dir;
            break;
        }
    }

If you know the name exactly, you can use an [attribute search](#search-attribute) (e.g., `$search->addEquals('name', 'My Directory')`) or, if you only know a small part, you can use a [filter search](#search-filter) (e.g., `$search->filter='My'`) to narrow down the selection.

<a class="anchor" name="directory-create"></a>
### Create a Directory

To create a directory to store user accounts, you must know which type of directory service to use.

You can create a:

* Cloud directory, which is hosted by Stormpath and uses the Stormpath data model to store account and group information. This is the most common type of directory in Stormpath.

**OR**

* Mirrored directory, which uses a synchronization agent for your existing LDAP/AD directory. All user account management is done on your existing LDAP/AD directory with the Stormpath agent mirroring the primary LDAP/AD server.

<a class="anchor" name="create-a-cloud-directory"></a>
#### Create a Cloud Directory

To create a new `directory` resource within the caller tenant:

**Resource URI**

    /v1/directories/:directoryId

**Required Attribute**

* [name](#directory-resource-name)

**Optional Attributes**

* [description](#directory-resource-description)
* [status](#directory-resource-status)

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $directory = \Stormpath\Resource\Directory::create(
        array('name' => 'Captains',
              'description' => 'Captains from a variety of stories'));

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $directory = $client->
                 dataStore->
                 instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::DIRECTORY);

    $directory->name = 'Captains';
    $directory->description = 'Captains from a variety of stories';

    $tenant->createDirectory($directory);

<a class="anchor" name="directories-mirrored"></a>
#### Create a Mirrored (LDAP/AD) Directory

Mirrored directories, after initial configuration, are accessible through the Agents tab of the directory.

To create an LDAP/AD mirrored directory, you must log in to the Stormpath Admin Console.

For more information on setting up a Mirrored Directory and using the Stormpath Admin Console, refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](/console/product-guide#!CreateDir).

<a class="anchor" name="associate-directories-with-applications"></a>
#### Associate Directories with Applications

In order to associate a directory with an application, you'll need to create an [Account Store Mapping](#account-store-mappings). An account store mapping associates an account store (such as a directory or a group) with an application.

You do this by calling the `create` method on the `AccountStoreMapping` resource class, or by calling the `createAccountStoreMapping` on an `Application` instance, and passing the `directory` as the `accountStore`.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $accountStoreMapping = \Stormpath\Resource\AccountStoreMapping::create(
        array('accountStore' => $directory,
              'application' => $application,
              'isDefaultAccountStore' => true,
              'isDefaultGroupStore' => true,
              'listIndex' => 0)
        );

Or, creating it from an application instance:

    $accountStoreMapping = \Stormpath\Resource\AccountStoreMapping::instantiate(
        array('accountStore' => $directory,
              'isDefaultAccountStore' => true,
              'isDefaultGroupStore' => true,
              'listIndex' => 0)
        );

     $application->createAccountStoreMapping($accountStoreMapping);

Notice that when creating the account store mapping from an application we didn't need to specify the application when we called the static `instantiate` method of the `AccountStoreMapping` class.

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $accountStoreMapping = $client->
                         dataStore->
                         instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT_STORE_MAPPING);
    $accountStoreMapping->accountStore = $directory;
    $accountStoreMapping->defaultAccountStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->defaultGroupStore = true;
    $accountStoreMapping->listIndex = 0;
    $application->createAccountStoreMapping($accountStoreMapping);

You may use the response's `$accountStoreMapping` instance to further interact with your new `AccountStoreMapping` resource.

For more information on Account Store Mappings, refer to the [Account Store Mapping](#account-store-mappings) section.

<a class="anchor" name="directory-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve a Directory

Retrieve a directory by calling the `get` method on the `Directory` resource class, or using the data store of the Client, and passing the directory `href` as the parameter.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/bckhcGMXQDujIXpbCDRb2Q';
    $directory = \Stormpath\Resource\Directory::get($href);

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $directory = $client->
                 dataStore->
                 getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::DIRECTORY);

<a class="anchor" name="directory-resources-expand"></a>
#### Expandable Resources

When retrieving a directory, you can also retrieve one or more of its linked resources by [expanding them in-line](#links-expansion) using the expansion options.

The following `Directory` attributes are expandable:

* `accounts`
* `groups`
* `tenant`

Also, because `accounts` and `groups` are [Collection Resources](#collections) themselves, you can additionally control [pagination](#pagination) for either expanded collection. For example:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('groups', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 50))->
                addProperty('accounts', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 50))->
                addProperty('tenant');
    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($accountHref, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'groups(offset:0,limit:10),accounts(offset:0,limit:50),tenant')`.

See the [Link Expansion](#links-expansion) section for more information on expanding link attributes.

<a class="anchor" name="directory-update"></a>
### Update a Directory

Use the `save` method when you want to change one or more specific attributes of a `directory` resource. Unspecified attributes will not be changed, but at least one attribute must be specified.

**Optional Attributes**

* [name](#directory-resource-name)
* [description](#directory-resource-description)
* [status](#directory-resource-status)

**Example Request**

    $directory->name = "Captains";
    $directory->save();

<a class="anchor" name="enable-or-disable-a-directory"></a>
#### Enable Or Disable a Directory

A directory has two statuses: enabled and disabled. An enabled directory allows the groups and accounts to log into any applications for which the directory is defined as an account store while a disabled directory does not.

To enable or disable a directory, use the `save` method to set the `status` to either `ENABLED` or `DISABLE`.

**Example Request**

    $directory->status = 'enabled';
    $directory->save();

<a class="anchor" name="update-agent-configuration"></a>
#### Update Agent Configuration

A [Directory Agent](#directory-agent) is a Stormpath software application installed on your corporate network to securely synchronize an on-premise directory, such as LDAP or Active Directory, into a Stormpath cloud directory. This is critical part of [a mirrored directory](#directories-mirrored).

You can modify an agent configuration going through the "Directories" or "Agent" tabs on the Stormpath Admin Console. For more information on administering Mirrored Directory agents, refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!UpdateAgent).

<a class="anchor" name="directory-delete"></a>
### Delete a Directory

Deleting a directory completely erases the directory and all group and account data from Stormpath.

We recommend that you disable a directory rather than delete it, in case an associated application contains historical data associated with accounts in the directory.

The Stormpath Administrators directory cannot be deleted.

To delete a directory:

**Example Request**

    $directory->delete();

{% docs warning %}
You cannot delete a directory that is still associated with an application and thus you cannot delete a directory that is marked as the "Default Account Store" or contains a "Default Group" doing so will result in a 400 Bad Request error
{% enddocs %}

**Example Error Response**

    {
      status: 400
      code: 400
      message: "Directory is referenced by 1 Application(s) and may not be deleted until those applications are disassociated"
      developerMessage: "Directory is referenced by 1 Application(s) and may not be deleted until those applications are disassociated"
      moreInfo: "mailto:support@stormpath.com"
    }

<a class="anchor" name="directory-list"></a>
### List Directories

To list directories:

**Example Request**

    $directories = $tenant->directories;
    foreach($directories as $dir)
    {
        print $dir->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="directory-search"></a>
### Search Directories

Directory attributes supported for search include:

* name
* description
* status

**Searchable Directory Collection Resources**

Directory Collection Resource | Search Functionality
:----- | :-----
$tenant->directories | A search across directories owned by the specified tenant.

<a class="anchor" name="work-with-directories"></a>
### Work With Directories

From a directory you can do things like enforce account password restrictions, register new accounts and groups, configure the account email verification workflow, configure the account password reset workflow, among other functionalities. Read below to find more information about these features.

<a class="anchor" name="directories-password-restrictions"></a>
### Enforce Account Password Restrictions

Directories can be configured to enforce specific restrictions on passwords for accounts associated with, such as requiring at least one or more non-alphanumeric characters.

With Stormpath's Cloud directories, you can configure custom restrictions for the passwords on accounts associated with that directory. You can specify the following elements in your directory's password requirements:

* Min characters
* Max characters
* Mandatry characters
  * Lower case alphabetical
  * Uppercase case alphabetical
  * Numeric
  * Punctuation
  * Special characters (e.g., Ã©)

By default, passwords must be of mixed case, include at least one number, and be between 8 and 100 characters in length.

More information about configuring a cloud directory's password restrictions can be found in the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](http://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!CreateDir).

{% docs note %}
Workflows are only available on cloud directories and only configurable using the Stormpath Admin Console.  They are not currently configurable via the REST API. Also, the Stormpath Administrator directory's automated workflows cannot be altered.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="directories-account-reg"></a>
### Register A New Account

This workflow allows you to create an account at a directory level.

This workflow relies on the `account` resource as a starting point. For more information refer to the [Create an Account](#account-create) section of this guide.

<a class="anchor" name="directories-group-reg"></a>
### Register A New Group

This workflow allows you to create an group at a directory level.

This workflow relies on the `group` resource as a starting point. For more information refer to the [Create a Group](#group-create) section of this guide.

<a class="anchor" name="directories-verify-email"></a>
### Verify An Account's Email Address

This workflow allows you to send a welcome email to a newly registered account and optionally verify that they own the email addressed used during registration.

The email verification workflow involves changes to an account at an application level, and as such, this workflow relies on the `account` resource as a starting point. For more information on working with these workflows via the PHP SDK after they have already been configured, refer to the [Working With Accounts](#account-verify-email) section of this guide.
This workflow is disabled by default for accounts, but you can enable it easily in the Stormpath Admin Console UI. Refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!ManageWorkflowAutomation) for complete instructions.

{% docs note %}
Workflows are only available on cloud directories and only configurable using the Stormpath Admin Console. They are not currently configurable via the PHP SDK. Also, the Stormpath Administrator directory's automated workflows cannot be altered.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="directories-password-reset"></a>
### Reset An Account's Password

This is a self-service password reset workflow.  The account is sent an email with a secure link.  The person owning the account can click on the link and be shown a password reset form to reset their password.  This is strongly recommended to reduce support requests to your application team as well as to reduce your exposure to account passwords for added security.

The password reset workflow involves changes to an account at an application level, and as such, this workflow relies on the `application` resource as a starting point. For more information on working with this workflow via the PHP SDK after they have already been configured, refer to the [Working With Applications](#application-password-reset) section of this guide.

This workflow is disabled by default for accounts, but you can enable it easily in the Stormpath Admin Console UI. Refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!ManageWorkflowAutomation) for complete instructions.

<a class="anchor" name="directory-groups"></a>
### Directory Groups

The `Groups` Collections for a `Directory` Resource Collection Resource represents all groups owned by a specific directory.

**Directory Groups Collection Resource**

    $directory->groups

#### List Directory Groups

You can list your directory's groups by sending a request to your directory's `groups` Collection Resource.  The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of directory groups.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $groups = $directory->groups;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

#### Search Directory Groups

You may search for groups by sending a request to your directory's `groups` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search). Any matching groups within your directory will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Group Attributes

The following [account attributes](#account-resource) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `name`
* `description`

In addition to the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $groups = $directory->groups;
    $groups->search = 'foo';
    $groups->order = 'name';
    $groups->offset = 0;
    $groups->limit = 50;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

#### Working With Directory Groups

Group resources support the full suite of CRUD commands and other interactions. Please see the [Groups section](#groups) for more information.

<a class="anchor" name="directory-accounts"></a>
### Directory Accounts

The `Accounts` Collection for a `Directory` Resource Collection Resource represents all accounts owned by a specific directory.

**Directory Accounts Collection Resource**

    $directory->accounts

#### List Directory Accounts

You can list your directory's accounts by sending a request to your directory's `groups` Collection Resource. The response is a [paginated](#pagination) list of directory groups.

You may also use collection [pagination](#pagination) and [sort ordering](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.

**Example Request**

    $accounts = $directory->accounts;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName;
    }

#### Search Directory Accounts

You may search for accounts by sending a request to your directory's `account` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search). Any matching groups within your directory will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Account Attributes

The following [account attributes](#account-resource) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `username`
* `email`
* `givenName`
* `middleName`
* `surname`

In addition to the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $accounts = $directory->accounts;
    $accounts->search = 'foo';
    $accounts->order = 'givenName';
    $accounts->offset = 0;
    $accounts->limit = 50;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName;
    }

#### Working With Directory Accounts

Account resources support the full suite of CRUD commands and other interactions. Please see the [Accounts section](#accounts) for more information.

<a class="anchor" name="groups"></a>
## Groups

Groups are collections of accounts within a directory that are often used for authorization and access control to the application. In Stormpath, the term group is synonymous with [role](#role).

You manage LDAP/AD groups on your primary LDAP/AD installation. LDAP/AD accounts and groups are automatically deleted when:

* The backing object is deleted from the LDAP/AD directory service.
* The backing LDAP/AD object information no longer matches the account filter criteria configured for the agent.
* The LDAP/AD directory is deleted.

<a class="anchor" name="group"></a>
### Group Resource

**Resource URI**

    /v1/groups/:groupId

**Resource Attributes**

Attribute | Description | Type | Valid Value
:----- | :----- | :---- | :----
`href` | The resource fully qualified location URI | String | <span>--</span>
<a id="group-resource-name"></a>`name` | The name of the group. Must be unique within a directory. | String | 1 < N <= 255 characters
<a id="group-resource-description"></a>`description` | The description of the group. | String | 1 < N <= 1000 characters
<a id="group-resource-status"></a>`status` | Enabled groups are able to authenticate against an application. Disabled groups cannot authenticate against an application. | Enum  |`enabled`,`disabled`
<a class="anchor" name="group-resource-tenant"></a>`tenant` | The tenant that owns the directory containing this group. | Link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="directory-resource-directory"></a>`directory` | A link to the directory resource that the group belongs to. | Link | <span>--</span>
<a class="anchor" name="directory-resource-accounts"></a>`accounts` | A link to the accounts that are contained within this group. | Link | <span>--</span>

With groups, you can:

* [Locate a group's REST URL](#group-url)
* [Create a group](#group-create)
* [Retrieve a group](#group-retrieve)
* [Update a group](#group-update)
    * [Enable a group](#group-enable)
    * [Disable a group](#group-disable)
* [Delete a group](#group-delete)
* [List groups](#groups-list)
* [Search groups](#groups-search)
* [Access a group's accounts](#group-accounts)
* [Manage a group's account memberships](#group-account-memberships)

<a class="anchor" name="group-url"></a>
### Locate a Group's REST URL

When communicating with the Stormpath REST API, you might need to reference a group directly using its REST URL or `href`.

There are multiple ways to find a group `href` depending on what information you have available:

* Retrieve a group from a specific directory
* Retrieve a group from a specific account's `groupMemberships`
* Retrieve a group from the application's full list of groups

In all cases, the process is fundamentally the same. Consider the first case as example.

In order to locate a group's `href`, you'll need to first search the tenant for the specific group using some information that you have available.

For example, if you want to find  a group with the name "My Group", you'll need to search the directory for the "My Group" `group` resource:

**Example Request**

    $groups = $directory->getGroups(array('name' => 'My Group'));
    $group = false;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        $group = $grp;
    }

If you know the name exactly, you can use an [attribute search](#search-attribute) (e.g., `array('name' => 'My Group')`) or, if you only know a small part, you can use a [filter search](#search-filter) (e.g., `array('q' => 'My')`) to narrow down the selection.

<a class="anchor" name="group-create"></a>
### Create a Group

To create a new `group` resource instance in a specified directory which is accessible to the application:

**Required Attributes**

* [name](#group-resource-name)

**Optional Attributes**

* [description](#group-resource-description)
* [status](#group-resource-status)

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $group = \Stormpath\Resource\Group::instantiate(array('name' => 'Aquanauts',
                                                          'description' => 'Sea Voyagers',
                                                          'status' => 'enabled'));

    $directory->createGroup($group);

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $group = $client->
             dataStore->
             instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::GROUP);
    $group->name = 'Aquanauts';
    $group->description = 'Sea Voyagers';
    $group->status = 'enabled';

    $directory->createGroup($group);

This creates a new group in the directory.

<a class="anchor" name="group-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve a Group

A request to the `get` method of the `Group` resource class, or requesting a group via the Client data store, returns a representation of a `group` resource that includes the resource attributes.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/groups/ZgoHUG0oSoVNeU0K4GZeVQ'
    $group = \Stormpath\Resource\Group::get($href);

**Example Request Using a Client Instance**

    $group = $client->
             dataStore->
             getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::GROUP);

<a class="anchor" name="group-resources-expand"></a>
#### Expandable Resources

When retrieving a group, you can also retrieve one or more of its linked resources by [expanding them in-line](#links-expansion) using the expansion options.

The following `Group` attributes are expandable:

* `tenant`
* `directory`
* `accounts`

Also, because `accounts` is a [Collection Resources](#collections) itself, you can additionally control [pagination](#pagination) for either expanded collection.  For example:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('tenant')->
                addProperty('directory')->
                addProperty('accounts', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 50));
    $group = \Stormpath\Resource\Group::get($href, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'tenant,directory,accounts(offset:0,limit:50)`.

See the [Link Expansion](#links-expansion) section for more information on expanding link attributes.

<a class="anchor" name="group-update"></a>
### Update a Group

Use the `save` method when you want to change one or more specific attributes of a `group` resource. Unspecified attributes are not changed, but at least one attribute must be specified.

**Optional Attributes**

* [name](#group-resource-name)
* [description](#group-resource-description)
* [status](#group-resource-status)

**Example Request**

    $group->description = "Sea Voyagers";
    $group->save();

<a class="anchor" name="group-enable"></a>
#### Enable a Group

If the group is contained within an *enabled directory where the directory is defined as an account store*, then enabling the group allows all accounts contained within the group (membership list) to log in to any applications for which the directory is defined as an account store.

If the group is contained within an *disabled directory where the directory is defined as an account store*, the group members are not be able to log in to any applications for which the directory is defined as an account store.

If the group is defined as an account store, then enabling the group allows accounts contained within the group (membership list) to log in to any applications for which the group is defined as an account store.

To enable a group:

**Example Request**

    $group->status = "enabled";
    $group->save();

<a class="anchor" name="group-disable"></a>
#### Disable a Group

If a group is explicitly set as an application account store, then disabling that group prevents any of its user accounts from logging into that application but retains the group data and memberships. You would typically disable a group if you must shut off a group of user accounts quickly and easily.

If the group is contained within a directory defined as an account store, disabling the group prevents group members from logging in to any applications for which the directory is defined as an account store.

To disable a group:

**Example Request**

    $group->status = "disabled";
    $group->save();

<a class="anchor" name="group-delete"></a>
### Delete a Group

Deleting a cloud directory group erases the group and all its membership relationships. User accounts that are members of the group will not be deleted.

We recommend that you disable an group rather than delete it, if you believe you might need to retain the user data or application connection.

To delete a cloud directory group:

**Example Request**

    $group->delete();

<a class="anchor" name="groups-list"></a>
### List Groups

#### Application Groups

The application groups is a [Collection Resource](#collections) representing all application-accessible groups. A group is accessible to an application if it, or its directory, is assigned to the application as an account store.

    $application->groups

HTTP GET returns a paginated list of links for groups accessible to an application.

**Example request:**

    $groups = $application->groups;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

##### Account Groups

The account `groups` resource is a [Collection Resource](#collections) representing all account-associated groups. A group is associated with an account when an account has been assigned to that group as a member.

    $account->groups

The request returns a paginated list of links for groups for which an account is a member.

**Example Request**

    $groups = $account->groups;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

##### Directory Groups

The directory `groups` resource is a [Collection Resource](#collections) representing all directory-associated groups. Groups are defined as a subset of members in a directory.

    $directory->groups

HTTP GET returns a paginated list of links for groups for which an account is a member.

**Example Request**

    $groups = $directory->groups;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="groups-search"></a>
### Search Groups

Group attributes supported for search:

* name
* description
* status

**Searchable Group Collection Resources**

Group Collection Resource | Search Functionality
:----- | :-----
$directory->groups | A search across groups in the specified directory.
$application->groups | A search across groups accessible to the specified application.
$account->groups    | A search across groups assigned to the specified account.

<a class="anchor" name="group-accounts"></a>
### Group Accounts

The Group `accounts` Collection for a `Group` Resource represents all accounts that are members of a specific group.

**Group Accounts Collection Resource**

    $group->accounts

The request returns a paginated list of links for accounts that are members of a specific group.

**Example Request**

    $accounts = $group->accounts;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="group-accounts-search"></a>
#### Search Group Accounts

You may search for directories by sending a  request to your application's `accounts` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search).  Any matching directories with your tenant will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Account Attributes

The following [account attributes](#account-resource) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `givenName`
* `middleName`
* `surname`
* `username`
* `email`

In addition to the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $accounts = $group->accounts;
    $accounts->search = 'foo';
    $accounts->order = 'givenName';
    $accounts->offset = 0;
    $accounts->limit = 50;

    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="working-with-group-accounts"></a>
#### Working With Group Accounts

Account resources support the full suite of CRUD commands and other interactions. Please see the [Accounts section](#accounts) for more information.

<a class="anchor" name="group-account-memberships"></a>
### Account Memberships

The `accountMemberships` Collection for a `group` Resource represents all account memberships where a specific group is a member. In this case, Account Memberships are simply an alternative, context-specific name for [Group Memberships](#group-memberships).

**Account Memberships Collection Resource**

    $group->accountMemberships

#### List Account Memberships

A request returns a Collection Resource containing the group memberships to which a specific group is a member.

**Example Request**

    $accountMemberships = $group->accountMemberships;
    foreach($accountMemberships as $ams)
    {
        print $ams->group->name;
        print $asm->account->givenName;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="working-with-group-account-memberships"></a>
#### Working With Account Memberships

`Account Membership` is a context-specific alias for a `Group Membership`.  Group Membership resources support the full suite of CRUD commands and other interactions. Please see the [Group Memberships section](#group-memberships) for more information.

***

<a class="anchor" name="group-memberships"></a>
## Group Memberships

A Group Membership resource represents the link between an [account](#accounts) and a [group](#groups). When an account is associated with a group or a group is associated with an account, a group membership is created.

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-resource"></a>
### Group Membership Resource

**Resource URI**

    v1/groupMemberships/:groupMembershipId

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-resource-attributes"></a>
**Resource Attributes**

Attribute | Description | Type | Valid Value
:----- | :----- | :---- | :----
<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-href"></a>`href` | The resource fully qualified location URI. | String | â€”
<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-account"></a>`account` | A link to the account of the group membership. | Link | â€”
<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-group"></a>`group` | A link to the group of the group membership. | Link | â€”

For group memberships, you can:

* [Locate a group membership's REST URL](#group-membership-url)
* [Create a group membership](#group-membership-create)
* [Retrieve a group membership](#group-membership-retrieve)
* [Delete a group membership](#group-membership-delete)
* [List group membership resources](#group-memberships-list)

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-url"></a>
### Locate a Group Membership's REST URL

When communicating with the Stormpath REST API, you might need to reference a group membership using the REST URL or `href`.

There are multiple ways to find a group membership, depending on what information you have available:

* Retrieve a full list of group memberships for an account
* Retrieve a full list of group members (as group membership pairings) for a group

In all cases, the process is fundamentally the same. Consider the first case as example. If you want to find a specific group mapping on a specific account,  you'll need to search the group memberships for the associated `account` resource:

**Example Request**

    $groupMemberships = $account->groupMemberships;
    $groupMembership = false;
    foreach($groupMemberships as $gms)
    {
        if ($gms->group->name == 'Group Name')
        {
            $groupMembership = $gms;
            break;
        }
    }

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-create"></a>
### Create a Group Membership

To create a group membership you need the account and the group.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $groupMembership = \Stormpath\Resource\GroupMembership::create(array('account' => $account, 'group' => $group));

**Example Request Using the Account or Group Instance**

    $account->addGroup($group);

Or, from the group

    $group->addAccount($account);

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve a Group Membership

A request returns a representation of a `groupMembership` resource that includes the account and the group hrefs.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/groupMemberships/249Up9ojT6NUNEYocdG4Dj';
    $groupMembership = \Stormpath\Resource\GroupMembership::get($href);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/groupMemberships/249Up9ojT6NUNEYocdG4Dj';
    $groupMembership = $client->dataStore->getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::GROUP_MEMBERSHIP);

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-resources-expand"></a>
#### Expandable Resources

When retrieving an application, you can also retrieve one or more of its linked resources by [expanding them in-line](#links-expansion) using the expansion options.

The following `Application` attributes are expandable:

* `account`
* `group`

See the [Link Expansion](#links-expansion) section for more information on expanding link attributes.

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-delete"></a>
### Delete a Group Membership

Deleting a group membership completely erases the `groupMembership` resource from Stormpath. This operation does not delete the group or the account involved in the group membership, only the association between them.

**Example Request**

    $groupMembership->delete();

<a class="anchor" name="group-memberships-list"></a>
### List Group Memberships

You can list group memberships by [account](#group-membership-by-account) or [group](#account-membership-by-group).

<a class="anchor" name="group-membership-by-account"></a>
#### List Group Memberships For An Account

The account `groupMemberships` resource is a [Collection Resource](#collections) representing all group memberships where the account is involved.

    $account->groupMemberships

A request returns a paginated list of the group memberships where the account is involved.

**Example Request**

    $groupMemberships = $account->groupMemberships;
    foreach($groupMemberships as $gms)
    {
        print $gms->account->givenName;
        print $gms->group->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="account-membership-by-group"></a>
#### List Account Memberships For A Group

The group `accountMemberships` resource is a collections representing all group memberships where the group is involved.

    $group->accountMemberships

List Group Group Memberships (HTTP GET)

A request returns a paginated list of the group memberships where the group is involved.

**Example Request**

    $accountMemberships = $group->accountMemberships;
    foreach($accountMemberships as $ams)
    {
        print $ams->account->givenName;
        print $ams->group->name;
    }

## Accounts

An Account is a unique identity within a Directory, with a unique username and/or email address. An account can log in to applications using either the email address or username associated with it. Accounts can represent your end users (people), but they can also be used to represent services, daemons, processes, or any "entity" that needs to login to a Stormpath-enabled application.  Additionally, an account may only exist in a single directory and may be in multiple groups owned by that directory.  Accounts may not be assigned to groups within other directories.

It should be noted that the words 'User' and 'Account' usually mean the same thing, but there is a subtle difference that can be important at times:

- An Account is a unique identity within a Directory.
- When an account is granted access to an application (by [mapping a Directory or Group](#account-store-mappings) that contains the account to the application), it becomes a 'User' of that application.

Therefore an Account can be called a 'User' of an application if/when it can login to the application.

#### LDAP/AD Accounts

It should be noted that Accounts that originate in LDAP or Active Directory (AD) are mirrored in Stormpath, and they are special: you cannot create, update or delete Accounts that originate in an LDAP mirrored directory - you can only read them or use them for login.  This is because LDAP is the source of 'truth' and Stormpath does not (currently) have write-access to LDAP installations.

You manage LDAP/AD accounts on your primary LDAP/AD installation. LDAP/AD accounts and groups are automatically deleted when:

* The backing object is deleted from the LDAP/AD directory service.
* The backing LDAP/AD object information no longer matches the account filter criteria configured for the agent.
* The LDAP/AD directory is deleted.

An account is a unique identity within a directory. An account can exist in only a single directory but can be a part of multiple groups owned by that directory.

For accounts, you can:

* [Locate an account's REST URL](#accounts-url)
* [Create an account](#account-create)
* [Retrieve an account](#account-retrieve)
* [Update an account](#account-update)
    * [Assign accounts to groups](#account-add-group)
    * [Remove accounts from groups](#account-remove-group)
    * [Enable or Disable an account](#account-enable)

* [Access an account's groups](#account-groups)
* [Manage an account's group memberships](#account-group-memberships)

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-url"></a>
### Locate an Account's REST URL

In order to locate an account's REST URL, you'll need to first search for the account via either an [application](#application) or a [directory](#directory) resource using specific information you have available.

For example, if you want to find an account with the username "test" across an application, you'll need to search the application for the "test" account object:

**Example Request**

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    $search = new \Stormpath\Resource\Search();
    $accounts->search = $search->addEquals('username', 'test');
    $account = false;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        $account = $acc;
    }

If you know the username exactly, you can use an [attribute search](#search-attribute) (e.g., `$search->addEquals('username', 'test')`) or, if you only know a small part, you can use a [filter search](#search-filter) (e.g., `$search->filter = 'test'`) to narrow down the selection.

<a class="anchor" name="account-create"></a>
### Create an Account

Through Stormpath's API and Admin Console, you can only create accounts for cloud, or Stormpath-managed, directories. For LDAP, the accounts must be created on the LDAP server and they will be mirrored to the Stormpath agent.

**Required Attributes**

* [email](#email)
* [password](#password)
* [givenName](#givenName)
* [surname](#surname)

**Optional Attributes**

* [username](#username)
* [middleName](#middleName)
* [status](#status)

{% docs note %}
The password in the request is being sent to Stormpath as plain text. This is one of the reasons why Stormpath only allows requests via HTTPS. Stormpath implements the latest password hashing and cryptographic best-practices that are automatically upgraded over time so the developer does not have to worry about this. Stormpath can only do this for the developer if Stormpath receives the plaintext password so we can hash it using these techniques.

Plaintext passwords also allow Stormpath to [enforce password restrictions](#directories-password-restrictions) in a configurable manner (e.g., you can configure your directories to reject passwords without mixed case and non-alphanumeric characters.)

Most importantly, Stormpath does not persist nor relay plaintext passwords in any circumstances.

On the client side, then, you do not need to worry about salting or storing passwords at any point; you need only pass them to Stormpath for hashing, salting, and persisting with the appropriate SDK API call (e.g., [Create An Account](#account-create) or [Update An Account](#account-update)).
{% enddocs %}

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::instantiate(
      array('givenName' => 'John',
            'surname' => 'Smith',
            'username' => 'johnsmith',
            'email' => 'john.smith@example.com',
            'password' => '4P@$$w0rd!'));

    $directory->createAccount($account);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $account = $client->dataStore->instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT);
    $account->email = 'john.smith@example.com';
    $account->givenName = 'John';
    $account->password ='4P@$$w0rd!';
    $account->surname = 'Smith';
    $account->username = 'johnsmith';

    $directory->createAccount($account);

**Example request suppressing the email messages (note the options array content):**

     $directory->createAccount($account, array('registrationWorkflowEnabled' => false));

<a class="anchor" name="account-retrieve"></a>
### Retrieve an Account

A request to the `get` method of the `Account` resource class, or to the Client data store, returns a representation of an `account` resource that includes the attributes.

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/cJoiwcorTTmkDDBsf02AbA';
    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($href);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $href = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/cJoiwcorTTmkDDBsf02AbA';
    $account = $client->dataStore->getResource($href, \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT);

<a class="anchor" name="account-resources-expand"></a>
#### Expandable Resources

When retrieving an account, you can also retrieve one or more of its linked resources by [expanding them in-line](#links-expansion) using the expansion options.

The following `Account` attributes are expandable:

* `tenant`
* `directory`
* `groups`
* `groupMemberships`

Also, because some of these are [Collection Resources](#collections) themselves, you can additionally control [pagination](#pagination) for either expanded collection.  For example:

    $expansion = new \Stormpath\Resource\Expansion();
    $expansion->addProperty('tenant')->
                addProperty('directory')->
                addProperty('groups', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 50))->
                addProperty('groupMemberships', array('offset' => 0, 'limit' => 50));

    $account = \Stormpath\Resource\Account::get($href, $expansion->toExpansionArray());

Using the Client data store:

    $account = $client->dataStore->getResource($href,
                                               \Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT,
                                               $expansion->toExpansionArray());

The result of a call to `$expansion->toExpansionArray()` will be the array `array('expand' => 'tenant,directory,groups(offset:0,limit:50),groupMemberships(offset:0,limit:50)'`.

See the [Link Expansion](#links-expansion) section for more information on expanding link attributes.

<a class="anchor" name="account-update"></a>
### Update an Account

Use the `save` method when you want to change one or more specific attributes of an `account` resource. Unspecified attributes will not be changed, but at least one attribute must be specified.

{% docs warning %}
Changes made to an account are immediately reflected in any application that has access to the account (based on applications' [account store mappings](#account-store-mappings)). Be careful updating an account for a single application's needs - ensure that the changes are OK for any and all applications that may access the account.
{% enddocs %}

**Optional Attributes**

* [username](#username)
* [email](#email)
* [password](#password)
* [givenName](#givenName)
* [middleName](#middleName)
* [surname](#surname)
* [status](#status)

{% docs note %}
The password in the request is being sent to Stormpath as plain text. This is one of the reasons why Stormpath only allows requests via HTTPS. Stormpath implements the latest password hashing and cryptographic best-practices that are automatically upgraded over time so the developer does not have to worry about this. Stormpath can only do this for the developer if Stormpath receives the plaintext password so we can hash it using these techniques.

Plaintext passwords also allow Stormpath to [enforce password restrictions](#directories-password-restrictions) in a configurable manner (e.g., you can configure your directories to reject passwords without mixed case and non-alphanumeric characters.)

Most importantly, Stormpath does not persist nor relay plaintext passwords in any circumstances.

On the client side, then, you do not need to worry about salting or storing passwords at any point; you need only pass them to Stormpath for hashing, salting, and persisting with the appropriate HTTPS API call (e.g., [Create An Account](#account-create) or [Update An Account](#account-update)).
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="UpdateAccountName"></a>
**Example Update Request**

    $account->username = "jlpicard";
    $account->givenName = "Jean-Luc";
    $account->surname = "Picard";
    $account->save();

If the account is part of a directory containing groups, you can associate the account with a group.

<a class="anchor" name="AddAccountGroup"></a>
**Example Request to Add an Account to a Group**

    $account->addGroup($group);

<a class="anchor" name="ChangeAccountPassword"></a>
**Example Request to Change an Account Password**

    $account->password = "L9%hw4c5q";
    $account->save();

<a class="anchor" name="account-add-group"></a>
#### Assign an Account to a Group

If the account is part of a directory containing groups, you can associate the account with a group.

To assign an account to a group:

**Example Request**

    $account->addGroup($group);

Both the account and the group must exist and contain a valid `href` property.

<a class="anchor" name="account-remove-group"></a>
#### Remove an Account from a Group

If the account is the member of a group within a directory, you can remove the account from the group by deleting the `groupMembership` resource that associates the two together:

**Example Request**

    $groupMembership->delete();

<a class="anchor" name="account-enable"></a>
#### Enable or Disable an Account

Accounts have an "status" which defines its state in the systems: enabled and disabled. An enabled account can be successfully authenticated if it is assigned to an active account store in an application while a disabled account cannot.

{% docs note %}
Enabling and disabling accounts for mirrored (LDAP) directories is not available in Stormpath. You manage mirrored (LDAP) accounts on the primary server installation.
{% enddocs %}

For example, to enable an account:

**Example Request**

    $account->status = "enabled";
    $account->save();

<a class="anchor" name="account-delete"></a>
### Delete an Account

Deleting an account completely erases the account from the directory and erases all account information from Stormpath.

{% docs warning %}
Deleting an account permanently removes the account from any application that has access to the account (based on applications' [account store mappings](#account-store-mappings)). Additionally, be careful deleting an account for a single application's needs - ensure that the deletion is OK for any and all applications that may access the account.
{% enddocs %}

To delete an account:

**Example Request**

    $account->delete();

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-list"></a>
### List Accounts

Using the API, you can view [all accounts of an application](#accounts-application-accounts-list), [all members of a group](#accounts-application-group-members), or [all accounts/members of a directory](#accounts-application-directory-accounts).

An application's `accounts` is a [Collection Resource](#collections) that represents all accounts that can log in to the application.

    $application->accounts

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-application-accounts-list"></a>
#### List Application Accounts

A request returns a paginated list of links for accounts within a specified application.

Example request:

    $accounts = $application->accounts;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $acc->surname;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-application-group-members"></a>
#### List Group Members

**Example Request**

    $accounts = $group->accounts;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $acc->surname;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-application-directory-accounts"></a>
#### List Directory Accounts

**Example Request From a Directory**

    $accounts = $directory->accounts;
    foreach($accounts as $acc)
    {
        print $acc->givenName . ' ' . $acc->surname;
    }

### Search Accounts

Account attributes supported for search:

* givenName
* surname
* email
* username
* middleName
* status

**Searchable Account Collection Resources**

Account Collection Resource | Search Functionality
:----- | :-----
$directory->accounts | A search across accounts in the specified directory.
$application->accounts | A search across accounts that are users of the specified application.
$group->accounts | A search across accounts in the specified group.

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-workflow"></a>
### Work With Accounts

If you want to learn about other account functionalities, such as [verify an email address](#account-verify-email), [log in (authenticate) an account](#accounts-authenticate) and [reset an account password](#accounts-reset), read the instructions below.

<a class="anchor" name="account-verify-email"></a>
### Verify An Email Address

If you want to verify that an account's email address is valid that the account belongs to a real person, Stormpath can help automate this for you, too.

#### Understanding The Email Verification Workflow

This workflow requires 3 parties to be involved: your application end-user, your application, and the Stormpath API server.

1. When the account is created in a Directory that has "Verification" enabled, Stormpath will email the account email address automatically.
2. The end-user opens his or her email and clicks the verification link.
3. With the token from the verification link clicked by the end-user, Your application calls back to the Stormpath API server to complete the process.

As mentioned previously, when you create a new account, it is stored in a Directory. If the account is created in a directory with both [Account Registration](#application-account-register) and Verification enabled, Stormpath will automatically send a welcome email that contains a verification link to the account's email address on your behalf. If the person reading the email clicks the verification link in the email, the account will then have an `ENABLED` status and be allowed to login to applications.

{% docs note %}
Accounts created in a Directory that has the Verification workflow enabled will have an `UNVERIFIED` status by default. `UNVERIFIED` is the same as `DISABLED`, but additionally indicates why the account is disabled. When the email link is clicked, they will have an `ENABLED` status.
{% enddocs %}

##### The Account Verification Base URL

It is also expected that the workflow's `Account Verification Base URL` has been set to a URL that will be processed by your own application web server. This URL should be free of any query parameters, as the Stormpath back-end will append on to the URL a parameter used to verify the email. If this URL is not set, a default Stormpath-branded page will appear which allows the user to complete the workflow.

{% docs note %}
The `Account Verification Base URL` defaults to a Stormpath API Sever URL which, while it is functional, is a Stormpath API server web page.  Because it will likely confuse your application end-users if they see a Stormpath web page, we strongly recommended that you specify a URL that points to your web application. Moreover, when specifying the Base URL, ensure it is a Base URL without query parameters
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-verification-configuration"></a>
#### Configure The Verification Workflow

This workflow is disabled by default on Directories, but you can enable it, and set up the account verification base URL, easily in the Stormpath Admin Console UI. Refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!ManageWorkflowAutomation) for complete instructions.

#### Trigger The Verification Email (Create A Token)

In order to verify an account's email address, an `emailVerificationToken` must be created for that account. To create this token, you simply create an account in a directory, either programmatically or via a public account creation form of your own design, that has the account registration and verification workflow enabled.

For example, if you were to request the account object for a user who has not yet been verified, via the REST API, you will note that the account `status` is set to `UNVERIFIED` and `emailVerificationToken` will have an `href`:

    {
      href: "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/6XLbNaUsKm3E0kXMTTr10V"
      username: "test"
      email: "frank@stormpath.com"
      fullName: "test test test"
      givenName: "test"
      middleName: "test"
      surname: "test"
      status: "UNVERIFIED"
     -groups: {
        href: "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/6XLbNaUsKm3E0kXMTTr10V/groups"
      }
     -groupMemberships: {
        href: "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/6XLbNaUsKm3E0kXMTTr10V/groupMemberships"
      }
     -directory: {
        href: "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/directories/5D1bvO5To6KQBaGFh793Zz"
      }-
     -tenant: {
        href: "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/tenants/23mq7BPIxNgPUPZDwj04SZ"
      }
     -emailVerificationToken: {
        href: "https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/emailVerificationTokens/6YJv9XBH1dZGP5A8rq7Zyl"
      }-
    }

{% docs tip %}
As an end-developer, all you need to do to create email verification tokens when a new account is created is to [configure the workflow](#accounts-verification-configuration) for the appropriate directory.
{% enddocs %}

#### Verifying The Account (Consume The Token)

When a new account is registered after configuration, either programmatically or through an account creation form in your application, an email verification token is created and Stormpath then automatically sends an email to the user. This email will include a link to the base URL you've [configured](#accounts-verification-configuration) with the following query string parameter:

    http://www.yourapplicationurl.com/path/to/validator?sptoken=$VERIFICATION_TOKEN

The token you capture from the query string is used to form the full `href` for a special email verification endpoint used to verify the account.

**Email Verification Tokens Collection Resource URI**

    /v1/accounts/emailVerificationsToken/:verificationToken

To verify the account, you use the token from the query string to form the above URL and call the `verifyEmailToken` on the Client class, or on the Client tenant instance:

**Example Request Using the Static Client Configuration**

    $account = \Stormpath\Client::verifyEmailToken($VERIFICATION_TOKEN);

**Example Request Using the Client Instance**

    $account = $client->tenant->verifyAccountEmail($VERIFICATION_TOKEN);

If the validation succeeds, you will receive back the `account` resource which has now been verified. An email confirming the verification will be automatically sent to the account's email address by Stormpath afterwards, and the account will then be able to authenticate successfully.

If the verification token is not found, a `404 Not Found` is returned with an [error payload](#error-handling) explaining why the attempt failed:

**Example Email Verification Failure Response**

    {
      status: 404
      code: 404
      message: "The requested resource does not exist."
      developerMessage: "The requested resource does not exist."
      moreInfo: "mailto:support@stormpath.com"
    }

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-authenticate"></a>
### Authenticate An Account

After an account has been created, you can authenticate an account given an input of a username or email and a password from the end-user.  When authentication occurs, you are authenticating a user within a specific application against the application's account stores. That being said, the `application` resource is the starting point for authentication attempts. 

For more information on working with applications and authentication, refer to the [Log in (Authenticate) an Account](#application-account-authc) section of this guide.

<a class="anchor" name="accounts-reset"></a>
### Reset An Account's Password

This is a self-service password reset workflow.  The account is sent an email with a secure link.  The person owning the account can click on the link and be shown a password reset form to reset their password.  This is strongly recommended to reduce support requests to your application team as well as to reduce your exposure to account passwords for added security.

The password reset workflow involves changes to an account at an application level, and as such, this workflow relies on the `application` resource as a starting point. For more information on working with this workflow via the PHP SDK after they have already been configured, refer to the [Working With Applications](#application-password-reset) section of this guide.

This workflow is disabled by default for accounts, but you can enable it easily in the Stormpath Admin Console UI. Refer to the [Stormpath Admin Console product guide](https://stormpath.com/docs/console/product-guide#!ManageWorkflowAutomation) for complete instructions.

{% docs note %}
Workflows are only available on cloud directories and only configurable using the Stormpath Admin Console.  They are not currently configurable via the PHP SDK. Also, the Stormpath Administrator directory's automated workflows cannot be altered.
{% enddocs %}

<a class="anchor" name="account-groups"></a>
### Account Groups

The account's `groups` resource is a [Collection Resource](#collections) which represents all groups where a specific account is a member.

**Resource URI**

    $account->groups

<a class="anchor" name="list-account-groups"></a>
#### List Account Groups

A request returns a Collection Resource containing links for all [groups](#groups) where a specific account is a member.

**Example Request**

    $groups = $account->groups;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

<a class="anchor" name="search-account-groups"></a>
#### Search Account Groups

You may search for directories by sending a request to your account's `groups` Collection Resource using [search query parameters](#search).  Any matching groups with your account will be returned as a [paginated](#pagination) list.

##### Searchable Group Attributes

The following [group attributes](#account-resource) are searchable via [filter](#search-filter) and [attribute](#search-attribute) searches:

* `name`
* `description`
* `status`

In addition to the [search query parameters](#search), you may also use [pagination](#pagination) and [sorting](#sorting) query parameters to customize the paginated response.  For example:

    $groups = $account->groups;
    $groups->search = 'foo';
    $groups->order = 'name';
    $groups->offset = 0;
    $groups->limit = 50;
    foreach($groups as $grp)
    {
        print $grp->name;
    }

### Account Group Memberships

An account's `groupMemberships` resource is a [Collection Resource](#collections) which represents all group memberships where a specific account is a member.

**Account Group Membership Collection Resource**

    $account->groupMemberships

#### List Account Group Memberships

A request returns a Collection Resource containing the group memberships to which a specific account is a member.

**Example Request**

    $groupMemberships = $account->groupMemberships;
    foreach($groupMemberships as $gms)
    {
        print $gms->account->givenName;
        print $gms->group->name;
    }

## Custom Data

`Account`, `Group`, `Directory`, and `Application` resources have predefined fields that are useful to many applications, but you are likely to have your own custom data that you need to associate with an resource as well.

For this reason, resources support a linked `CustomData` resource that you can use for your own needs.

The `CustomData` resource is a schema-less JSON object (aka 'map', 'associative array', or 'dictionary') that allows you to specify whatever name/value pairs you wish.

The `CustomData` resource is always connected to a resource and you can always reach it by calling `customData` magic method (alias to getCustomData()) on the resource instance:


    $application = \Stormpath\Resource\Application::get($applicationHref);

    $applicationCustomData = $application->customData;

    //Or

    $application = $client->
                 dataStore->
                 getResource($applicationHref, \Stormpath\Stormpath::APPLICATION);
                 
    $applicationCustomData = $application->customData;
  
In addition to your custom name/value pairs, a CustomData resource will always contain 3 reserved read-only fields:

* href: The fully qualified location of the custom data resource
* createdAt: the UTC timestamp with millisecond precision of when the resource was created in Stormpath as an ISO 8601 formatted string, for example 2017-04-01T14:35:16.235Z
* modifiedAt: the UTC timestamp with millisecond precision of when the resource was last updated in Stormpath as an ISO 8601 formatted string.

You can store an unlimited number of additional name/value pairs in the CustomData resource, with the following restrictions:

* The total storage size of a single CustomData resource cannot exceed 10 MB (megabytes). The href, createdAt and modifiedAt field names and values do not count against your resource size quota.
* Field names must:
    * be 1 or more characters long, but less than or equal to 255 characters long (1 <= N <= 255).
    * contain only alphanumeric characters 0-9A-Za-z, underscores _ or dashes - but cannot start with a dash -.
    * may not equal any of the following reserved names: href, createdAt, modifiedAt, meta, spMeta, spmeta, ionmeta, or ionMeta.

{% docs note %}
While the `meta`, `spMeta`, `spmeta`, `ionmeta`, or `ionMeta` fields are not returned in the response today, they might be used in the future.  As is the case with all JSON use cases, ensure your REST client will not break if it encounters one of these (or other fields it does not recognize) at some time in the future.
{% enddocs %}

For Custom Data, you can:

* [Create Custom Data](#create-custom-data)
* [Retrieve Custom Data](#retrieve-custom-data)
* [Update Custom Data](#update-custom-data)
* [Delete All Custom Data](#update-custom-data)
* [Delete a single Custom Data field](#delete-custom-data-field)

<a class="anchor" name="create-custom-data"></a>
### Create Custom Data

Whenever you create an account or a group, an empty `CustomData` resource is created for that account or group automatically - you do not need to explicitly execute a request to create it.

However, it is often useful to populate custom data at the same time you create an account or group. You can do this by embedding the `customData` directly in the resource. For example:

**Example Create Account with Custom Data**

    $account = $client->dataStore->instantiate(\Stormpath\Stormpath::ACCOUNT);
    $account->email = 'john.smith@example.com';
    $account->givenName = 'John';
    $account->password ='4P@$$w0rd!';
    $account->surname = 'Smith';
    $account->username = 'johnsmith';

    $customData = $account->customData;
    $customData->rank = "Captain";
    $customData->birthDate = "2305-07-13";
    $customData->favoriteDrink = "favoriteDrink";

    $directory->createAccount($account);

<a class="anchor" name="retrieve-custom-data"></a>
### Retrieve Custom Data

In order to retrieve a resource's custom data directly you can get the `CustomData` resource through the client instance providing the custom data href:


    $application = $client->
                     dataStore->
                     getResource($applicationHref, \Stormpath\Stormpath::APPLICATION);
                     
    $applicationCustomData = $application->customData;

After you have access to the whole custom data resource, you can then retrieve a specific property with the following.

    $property = $applicationCustomData->property;
 
<a class="anchor" name="update-custom-data"></a>
### Update Custom Data

You may update an account' or group's custom data, in one of two ways:

* by [updating the customData resource directly](#update-custom-data-directly), independent of the group or account, or
* by [embedding customData changes in an account or group update request](#update-custom-data-embedded)

<a class="anchor" name="update-custom-data-directly"></a>
#### Update Custom Data Directly

The first way to update an account or group's custom data is by saving changes directly to the `CustomData` resource.  This allows you to interact with the customData resource directly, without having to do so 'through' an account or group request.

In the following example request, we're interacting with a `CustomData` resource directly, and we're changing the value of an existing field named `favoriteColor` and we're adding a brand new field named `hobby`:

**Example Account Custom Data Update**

    $customData->favoriteColor = "red";
    $customData->hobby = "Kendo";
    $customData->save();

<a class="anchor" name="update-custom-data-embedded"></a>
#### Update Custom Data as part of an Account or Group Request

Sometimes it is helpful to update an account or group's `CustomData` as part of an update request for the resource.  In this case, just submit customData changes in an embedded `CustomData` field embedded in the account or group request resource.  For example:

    $account->status = "ENABLED";
    $customData = $account->customData;
    customData->favoriteColor = "blue";
    customData->favoriteMovie = "Star Wars";
    account->save();

In the above example, we're performing 3 modifications in one request:

1. We're modifying the account's `status` attribute and setting it to `ENABLED`.  We're _also_
2. Changing the existing customData `favoriteColor` field value to `blue` (it was previously `red`) and
3. Adding a new customData field `favoriteMovie` with a value of `Star Wars`.

This request modifies both the account resource _and_ that account's custom data in a single request.

#### Delete Custom Data
You may delete all of a resource's custom data by invoking the delete() method to the resource's CustomData

    $account->customData->delete();

This will delete all of the respective resource's custom data fields, but it leaves the `CustomData` placeholder in the resource. You cannot delete the `CustomData` resource entirely â€“ it will be automatically permanently deleted when the resource is deleted.

### Delete Custom Data Field

You may also delete an individual custom data field entirely by calling the remove() method on the resource's `CustomData` while stating the custom data field as a parameter.


    $customData->remove("favoriteColor");

## Glossary of Terms


Attribute | Description
:----- | :----- |
<a id="account"></a>Account | An **account** is a unique identity within a directory. Stormpath does not use the term *user* because it implies a person, while accounts can represent a person, 3rd-party software, or non-human clients. Accounts can be used to log in to applications.
<a id="agent"></a>Agent | An **agent** populates LDAP directories. An agent status reflects communication/error state because the agent is communicating with Stormpath.
<a id="apikey"></a>API Key | An **API key** is a unique ID paired with a secret value. API keys are used by software applications to communicate with Stormpath through the Stormpath REST API.
<a id="application"></a>Application | An **application** is a software application that communicates with Stormpath. It is typically a real world application that you are building, such as a web application, but it can also be infrastructural software, such as a Unix or Web server.
<a id="authentication"></a>Authentication | **Authentication** is the act of proving someone (or something) is actually who they say they are. When an account is authenticated, there is a high degree of certainty that the account identity is legitimate.
<a id="authorization"></a>Authorization | **Authorization**, also known as Access Control, is the process of managing and enforcing access to protected resources, functionality, or behavior.
<a id="directory"></a>Directory | A **directory** is a collection of accounts and groups. Administrators can use different directories to create silos of accounts. For example, customers and employees can be stored in different directories.
<a id="directory-agent"></a>Directory Agent | A **directory agent** is a Stormpath software application installed on your corporate network to securely synchronize an on-premise directory, such as LDAP or Active Directory, into a Stormpath cloud directory.
<a id="directory-mirroring"></a>Directory Mirroring | **Directory mirroring** securely replicates selected data from one (source) directory to another (target or mirrored) directory for authentication and access control. The source directory is the authoritative source for all data. Changes are propagated to the target/mirror directory for convenience and performance benefits.
<a id="group"></a>Group | A **group** is a collection of accounts within a directory. In Stormpath, for anyone familiar with Role-Based Access Control, the term group is used instead of role.
<a id="group-membership"></a>Group Membership | A **group membership** is a two-way mapping between an account and a group.
<a id="account-store"></a>Account Store | A **account store** is a directory or group associated with an application for account authentication. Accounts within account stores associated with an application can login to that application.
<a id="AccountStoreMapping"></a>Account Store Mapping | An **account store mapping** is a mapping between a group or directory and an application.
<a id="identity-management"></a>Identity Management | **Identity management** is the management, authentication, authorization, and permissions of identities to increase security and productivity, while decreasing cost, downtime, and repetitive tasks.
<a id="role"></a>Role |A **role** is a classification of accounts, such as administrators or employees. In Stormpath, roles are represented as groups.
<a id="rbac"></a>Role-Based Access Control | **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC) is the act of controlling access to protected resources or behavior based on the groups assigned to a particular account. RBAC is done using Stormpath groups.
<a id="rest-api-def"></a>REST API | **REST API** is a software architectural style enabling data transfer and functionality using common web-based communication protocols. Stormpath provides a REST API for tenants so they can easily integrate Stormpath with their software applications.
<a id="tenant"></a>Tenant | A **tenant** is a private partition within Stormpath containing all data and settingsâ€”specifically your applications, directories, groups and accounts. When you sign up for Stormpath, a tenant is created for you. You can add other user accounts (for example, for your co-workers) to your tenant to help you manage your data. For convenience, many companies like to have one tenant where they can easily manage all application, directory, and account information across their organization.*

{% docs note %}
*You must know your tenant when logging in to the Admin Console website. There is a "Forgot Tenant" link on the login page if you do not know what your tenant is.
